"""Closed-loop COVERAGE GATE (hand-authored -- NOT generated; do not run gen_data on this file).

A gen-time invariant that joins the apworld's OWN source tables and asserts, for every location
this seed EMITS (post option-filtering), that the location is

  (a) DETECTABLE   -- it carries a real acquisition flag present in the client's flag-poll table
                      (slot_data locationFlags) / shop-stock table (shopRowFlags), valid, not
                      aliased to another live location -- UNLESS the sharers form a declared
                      CO-CHECK GROUP (SPEC-flag-lot-item-model: one getItemFlagId drives several
                      ItemLotParam lots, each its own location; the client's poll is keyed by
                      ap_id -- flagpoll.rs location_flags: HashMap<i64,u32> -- so every member
                      fires when the flag sets). A shared flag is legal iff EVERY sharer has a
                      LOCATION_LOT binding (check_lots_data.py) and the bound (table, lot) pairs
                      are pairwise DISTINCT; per-member own-lot suppression is then enforced by
                      (b). Accidental aliasing (any sharer unbound, or two sharers on one lot)
                      stays a hard violation. Also disjoint from the system flags the client
                      itself writes (region-open + grace warp flags, map-reveal flags, the
                      deathlink-kill flag, the underground view flag);
  (b) SUPPRESSED   -- if it vanilla-holds a ware, a suppression mechanism exists so the vanilla
                      ware is not handed out alongside the AP-placed item. Since the 2026-07
                      runtime-param-rewrite suite suppression is STATIC + layered:
                        * GOODS wares are blanked AT THE LOT: the check's flag has an ItemLotParam
                          row in check_lots_table.json map/enemy, whose goods slots the client
                          repoints at AP_PLACEHOLDER_GOODS (features/check_lots.py ->
                          checkLotBlankMap/Enemy; er-logic static_lots.rs for foreign apworlds);
                        * WEAPON/ARMOR/TALISMAN/AoW wares are suppressed BY FullID
                          (check_lots_table.json "items" -> the client's checkItemFlags path);
                        * non-farmable wares are ALSO armed per-seed by
                          features/check_item_flags.py (checkItemFlags), which deliberately skips
                          REPEATABLE_GOODS (suppressing a farmable id eats every legitimate copy);
                        * SHOP checks deliver the vanilla ware as the purchase itself
                          (eventFlag_forStock detection; the AP item rides along).
  (c) REGION-CONSISTENT -- every source file that claims a region for the location agrees
                      (data.py / boss_data.py / boss_sweeps.py / region_graces.py /
                      shop_data.SHOP_LOC_REGION), the location's region has a valid
                      REGION_OPEN_FLAGS entry AND measured REGION_PLAY_IDS kick geometry, and
                      every boss-sweep gate sweeps only members whose canonical region matches
                      (the Full Moon Queen class);
  (d) AWARDED     -- the game can actually SET the flag: a non-shop check's flag must be carried
                      by an ItemLotParam row that hands something out (check_lots_table.json
                      map/enemy/items -- derived from the params, tools/gen_check_lots_table.py).
                      A flag with no awarding lot is unobtainable BY CONSTRUCTION: the flag-poll
                      can never observe it, the seed can never be 100%'d, and a progression item
                      placed there is a multiworld soft-lock (the phantom/synthetic-flag class:
                      177 and 320820, promoted from the monitored FOREIGN-gap 2026-07-14).

DESIGN (mirrors contract.py's single-source style; re-derivation of the orphaned
agent/coverage-gate branch, 12c1727, against the 2026-07-14 tree):
  * ``LocationCoverage``  -- the canonical per-location record (detection / suppression / region +
    region_claims across EVERY claimant + field->source provenance).
  * ``build_coverage(world=None, kept=None)`` -- JOINS the source tables for every emitted
    location. With a live ``world`` the scope is HUB + world._kept() and the emitted tables come
    from world.fill_slot_data(); with world=None it runs in STATIC mode (all regions, or an
    explicit pinned ``kept`` subset) and the tables are re-derived from the generated source
    files, so the seed-invariant data holes are caught without spinning a multiworld.
  * ``check_detection`` / ``check_suppression`` / ``check_region_consistency`` -- collect-ALL
    checks (every violation with provenance, never one-per-gen).
  * ``report_coverage(world=None, kept=None)`` -- runs all checks, returns the violation table
    WITHOUT raising (REPORT MODE -- tools/gen_coverage_report.py and the test tiers).
  * ``assert_coverage(world)`` -- the RAISING variant (CoverageError), WIRED into core.post_fill
    since 2026-07-14 (it debuted in report mode, soaked to a zero baseline, then flipped -- see
    core.py). A violation kills the seed before anything is spent on it.
  * structured degradation lives in ``coverage_quarantine.py`` (QUARANTINE / ACCEPTED_LEAKS),
    self-cleaning via ``_quarantine_violations``.

Flag-validity ranges are grounded, not invented: the region/grace open-flag group is 71xxx-76xxx
(region_open_flags.py; memory er-event-flag-validity), the map-reveal flags are the 62xxx set
mirrored from gen_data.py:132 / startgrants.rs, the deathlink-kill flag is 76996 (region locks
moved OFF it to 7697x, 2026-07; it is deathlink-only now) and the underground view flag is 82001
(features/start_grace.py). General acquisition flags span many allocated groups, so the general
predicate only rejects the provably-bad (<=0, or a system flag a check must never reuse) rather
than inventing a tight range that would false-positive on the ~4.8k real derived flags.
