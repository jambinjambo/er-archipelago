"""Patch 1.17 (Tarnished Pack) item-pool catalog and ownership boundary.

The 2026-08-28 param diff established 31 new rows. The shipped English FMGs do not name them, so
the 26 player-equipment names below are joined to IDs only where independent acquisition evidence
settles the mapping: starting loadouts, field/shop lots, or invasion co-awards. Two NPC-only weapon
bases and three Spectral Steed unlock goods deliberately remain outside the item pool.

The equipment is available only when the explicit ownership option is enabled. Non-owner grant/use
behaviour remains unproven, so default-off is the safety boundary rather than a hopeful runtime
grant. ``gen_data.py`` adds this roster to the generated catalog and gives it honorary S tier.

Source: clean pre-1.17/current ``gen_inputs.db`` param-table diff recorded on #1096. Weapon rows
are collapsed through ``originEquipWep`` so reinforcement variants count as one base item.
