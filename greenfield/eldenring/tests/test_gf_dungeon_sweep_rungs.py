"""dungeon_sweep's rungs must actually differ -- for a month they did not.

THE BUG. The slot_data emit gated on `dungeon_sweep.value != 0` and never filtered by boss class, so
`minidungeons`, `all` and `bosses` each granted the FULL sweep set. Three distinct player-facing
values, one behaviour. The option's own docstring described the ladder, the player guide repeated it,
and the v0.2.15 release notes told a player by name that `minidungeons` and `bosses` were "the two
middles". All of it was false, and nothing compared the values to each other.

🛑 A CHOICE WHOSE VALUES ARE INTERCHANGEABLE IS A TOGGLE WEARING A LADDER'S CLOTHES. Testing each
value in isolation -- "does it generate?", "does it emit a well-formed wire?" -- passes forever. The
only assertion that catches this compares the values AGAINST EACH OTHER, which is why the test below
is written as a strict ordering rather than four independent cases.

The default moved all -> bosses in the same change: the full set is what every non-none value
already granted, so `bosses` IS the shipped behaviour. Defaulting to `all` would have silently
dropped field sweeps (~38% of them) from every seed under cover of a bug fix.
