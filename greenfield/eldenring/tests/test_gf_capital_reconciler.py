"""Capital-version reconciler (features/capital.py; SPEC-capital-reconciler.md).

Ground truth (elden_ring_artifacts, 2026-07-14): flag 9116 selects which Leyndell loads (OFF =
Royal m11_00 / bucket 11000, ON = Ashen m11_05 / 11050 + Elden Throne m19 / 19000); its sole
vanilla setter is Maliketh's death (m13_00_00_00.emevd:409); common.emevd $Event(900) runs the
burn and latches 118 last. The client reconciles 9116 to the player's current/target capital, so
the burn never permanently strands the Royal checks -- and while the option is ON, the
ERDTREE_BURN_APS "may not carry progression" bar is LIFTED (the strand it guarded is gone).
