"""#707 -- the hub-merchant bar must BAR something, and must read a tag the data actually emits.

`features/progression_surface._roundtable_merchant_aps()` exists to keep this world's progression off
Roundtable Hold's merchant rows: the hub is reachable at spawn, so a Lock or key item sold there is
"progression" you already hold on turn one.

It returned the EMPTY SET from 2026-07-24 to 2026-08-16. It filtered on the tag `ShopSlot`, and the
2026-07-24 ShopSlot rework redefined that tag as "at most ONE progression slot per MERCHANT, pinned to
a merchant-unique ware" and stopped emitting it for hub rows -- 12 `ShopSlot` rows exist game-wide and
NONE of them is in the hub. The guard was written six days before the tag it read changed meaning
underneath it, and nothing failed, because **a derivation that reads a tag the data does not supply is
indistinguishable from a derivation with nothing to do.**

So this file tests the two things that would have caught it, neither of which is "does the fix work":

  1. the tag names the bar reads are names the HUB actually carries (test_tags_are_emitted_by_the_hub);
  2. the bar is NON-EMPTY, with the count pinned (test_bar_is_non_empty_and_pinned).

and one that pins the consequence at the chokepoint rather than in the helper, because an unfired
guard is an untested one and this one had no witness for three weeks
(test_chokepoint_drops_hub_merchants).

⚠️ THE PINNED COUNTS ARE GENERATED-DATA FACTS. A regen that adds or moves hub merchant rows will move
them, and that is the test doing its job: re-measure, satisfy yourself the delta is the regen and not a
tag rework quietly emptying the guard again, then update the number here deliberately.

        Golden Seed. #445's ground audit re-filed it Stormveil -- the Hold was never a derivation
        for it and its lot is placed on an m10_00 enemy (see gen_data.FLAG_REGION_OVERRIDE[400220])
        -- so the hub has NO Seedtree row now and pinning one would be pinning a row that left.
        The property was never about Seedtrees: it is that this bar touches merchant rows and
        nothing else. That is what is asserted, over every non-merchant hub row, which is strictly
        more than the one-row version ever covered.
