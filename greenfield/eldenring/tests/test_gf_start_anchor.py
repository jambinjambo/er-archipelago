"""start_with_region_lock anchor pick -- size-weighted over the kept BASE-game regions.

The precollected region Lock IS the run's opening region: the only region open from Roundtable at
sphere 0. The old pick was `random.choice` over every kept lock -- uniform -- which ignored two facts
the generated data already knows: region check counts span 13..543 (a uniform draw over all 31 opened
~1 run in 3 on a region under 80 checks; playtest 2026-07-14 opened on Castle Ensis, 31 checks), and
EVERY sub-80 region is DLC, where a fresh character also has zero scadutree blessing. The fix is
features/start_grace.pick_anchor_region: size-weighted (weight = emitted check count, derived from
data.LOCATIONS -- never a frozen table) over kept BASE regions, DLC fallback only when no base region
is kept (dlc_only), and the strict-surface MajorBoss bias INTERSECTING that eligibility instead of
replacing it.

What this guards (every expectation DERIVED from data.LOCATIONS / region_spine at test time -- no
hand-pinned region sizes to rot when a re-tag moves checks):
  * the anchor is NEVER a DLC region while any base region is kept, and never below the base floor;
  * the weighting BITES: the mean anchor size over many draws sits far above the old uniform-draw
    expectation AND above a merely-base-uniform pick (so DLC-exclusion alone can't pass it);
  * dlc_only degrades to a size-weighted DLC draw: deterministic, never a crash, and the smallest
    kept region is rare instead of 1-in-N;
  * strict surface (the only regime since 2026-08-14) intersects; an empty intersection degrades
    (rule says so) instead of raising;
  * count-neutrality holds across the sweep (the precollected lock leaves the pool; items == locations);
  * production CALLS the pure fn: the WorldTestBase sweep + the telemetry log line prove the wired
    path, not just the predicate (a green predicate with no caller is a spec, not a fix).

PIN num_regions in every world built here -- an unpinned num_regions is a known test-breaker.
