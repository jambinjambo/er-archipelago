"""Contract-snapshot test for the Greenfield ER world's slot_data -- WorldTestBase.

This is the CONTRACT-DRIFT GUARD for the client contract. The Rust client reads a fixed set of
slot_data keys. The single source of truth for the CONTRACT keys and their SHAPES is
`worlds.eldenring.contract` -- so the shape/required checks here delegate to
`contract.validate_slot_data(sd, strict=True)` and CANNOT go stale when a shape changes.

The keyset guard (test_exact_keyset) still asserts the emitted keyset EXACTLY, but it BUILDS the
expected set FROM the contract (every greenfield contract key the world emits) plus the small,
explicitly-listed set of INFORMATIONAL non-contract extras the world also emits (option echoes /
diagnostics the client does not parse). If a source change adds, renames, or drops a slot_data key,
this test fails -- forcing a conscious update here (and a look at whether the client was updated too).

Design (matches the other greenfield WorldTestBase suites):
  * importorskip AP + the installed world, so this is a no-op in the source-tree sandbox and only
    runs once the world is installed under Archipelago/worlds/.
  * option keys/values mirror the feature option classes in core.py + features/*.py:
      - item_shuffle (Toggle)               -> True
      - dungeon_sweep (Choice)              -> "all"   (emits dungeonSweepFlags/dungeonSweeps/sweepLockGates)
      - pool_builder_intensity (Choice)     -> max     (widest juice catalog; the option was
                                                       unfrozen 2026-07-28, `pool_builder` itself is retired)
      - ending_condition (Choice)           -> "great_runes" + great_runes_required=2

Run (from the Archipelago dir, world installed):
