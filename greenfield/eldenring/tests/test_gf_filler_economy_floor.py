"""TIER-A semantic gate: the filler tail has ONE budget, and the upgrade economy is entitled to its
share of it.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
--------------------
A live playtest seed on current HEAD (num_regions=4, the shipped frozen defaults, the playtest
`curated_filler` recipe) put the player in fill-sphere 2 holding a +0 weapon. Nothing raised, nothing
warned, every per-pass unit test stayed green -- because the defect is NOT inside any one pass. It is
an INTERACTION between three passes that each own a slice of the same filler tail and have no
contract with each other:

  1. features/pool_builder  (PASS 1, additive)   -- frozen at scope=all_filler / intensity=max /
     juice_cap=0 (defaults.py FROZEN_OPTIONS), it converts essentially the WHOLE junk-consumable
     larder into `useful`-classified gear.
  2. features/filler_curation.curate  (PASS 2, in-place swap) -- runs AFTER, and selects its
     candidates with `_is_junk_consumable(name) and not (classification & (progression|useful))`.
     pool_builder just marked the larder `useful`. curate() therefore finds an empty larder and the
     recipe's `stones:`/`runes:` weights deliver ~nothing.
  3. core.post_fill stone_ramp  (post-fill relabel) -- measures its deficit against the stones
     already placed, decides supply is adequate, and no-ops.

Three locally-correct mechanisms; one silently broken upgrade economy. This file is the regression
that makes that unrepresentable. It deliberately tests the COMPOSED DEFAULT PIPELINE -- the frozen
options exactly as shipped -- because a pass tested in isolation cannot see this class of bug. (Six
test_gf_pool_builder_*.py files and a filler_curation suite were all green while the seed was broken.)

THE ORACLES ARE DERIVED, NOT PINNED
-----------------------------------
Nothing here hardcodes an observed count (that would pin the symptom rather than the datum):

  * ENTITLEMENT: the vanilla junk-consumable items across the seed's KEPT regions are the larder --
    computed straight from LOCATIONS + LOCATION_ITEM + the shipped `_is_junk_consumable` predicate,
    with no pipeline involvement. A recipe category weighted w/W is entitled to (w/W) of that larder.
    Whoever ends up owning the filler tail, that entitlement must survive.
  * AFFORDABILITY: the early-stone floor is derived from the game's own upgrade ladder under the
    frozen `flatten_regular_upgrades`, not from a magic number. The contract is stated in player
    terms: a player who has cleared a realistic FRACTION of what is open to them at shallow depth
    must be able to afford a modest weapon level. Anything else is not a randomizer, it is a walk.

Both oracles are re-derived per seed, so they follow num_regions / the recipe / the flatten setting
instead of drifting away from them.

    2026-08-02, a player on a 1-region seed: "zero Somber Smithing Stone [3] in the game". A somber
    weapon costs ONE stone per level and the tier IS the level, so an absent tier is not a thin
    economy -- it is a WALL at that exact weapon level, for the whole seed. Density floors cannot see
    that; only PRESENCE can.

    Two holes let it ship, and this class closes both:

      * `filler_budget._draw_stones` did `if somber: return out` BEFORE the deepest-first top-up, so
        the guarantee the module advertises was regular-[1]-only and no somber tier had any floor.
      * `_assert_low_somber_early` -- the only somber gate there was -- checks tiers (1, 2) at
        num_regions=4. Tier 3, the tier the spec promises and the player reported, is exactly the one
        it does not look at, and 4 regions is exactly the size at which the bug is rarest.

    So: num_regions=1 (the reported size, and the worst case -- the smaller the seed the smaller the
    reservation), every tier 1..9, sampled over SOMBER_PRESENCE_DRAWS reseeded draws of the real
    allocator.

    THE ORACLE IS THE POOL, NOT THE RESERVATION. Vanilla somber stones on kept checks are PROTECTED
    from displacement (`_ECONOMY_SUBSTR` catches "Smithing Stone"), so they are genuinely in the
