"""Off means off: every CONDITIONALLY-EMITTED slot_data key must name its absent-when-off test.

MOTIVATING CASE (2026-08-04 inert-test audit, finding P1). test_gf_boss_locks.py carried
`test_sweeps_off_when_disabled` whose body was literally `pass`, inside a class that ran
`dungeon_sweep: "all"`. Replacing the emission gate in features/boss_locks.py
(`if world.options.dungeon_sweep.value != 0:`) with `if True:` left all 57 tests across the four
files referencing the option GREEN: a player who disabled dungeon_sweep still got whole-dungeon
auto-grants on boss kills, silently. The contract validator could not catch it either -- the sweep
keys are required=False, and an optional key that appears when it should not is exactly what
`validate_slot_data` is silent about. Per feature, the question "is the key ABSENT when the option
is off?" was asked nowhere except by accident (finding P1's sibling: scaduBlessingCap's off test
reasoned about the fixture's bookkeeping sets instead of generating an off world, so a broken gate
would have passed it too).

WHAT THIS FILE ENFORCES, for every ContractKey with required=False in the greenfield profile:
  1. An AST scan over core.py + features/*.py classifies each key's emission as UNCONDITIONAL
     (some producer emits it on every path through its function) or CONDITIONAL (every emission
     sits behind an `if`, or behind an early bare `return`, or no emission exists at all).
  2. Every CONDITIONAL key must have a row in OFF_LEDGER below, and the row is VERIFIED, not
     trusted: the named test must exist, its class must pin the named option to the named off
     value, and its body must contain an assertion that mentions the key. A row naming a test that
     does not exist, does not turn the option off, or never asserts on the key is RED.
  3. A NEW option-gated key added without its off-test therefore turns CI red the moment it lands
     (test_every_conditional_key_names_its_off_test). That ratchet is the point of this file.

DESIGN: LEDGER + SCAN, NOT PURE INFERENCE, NOT PURE PROSE.
  * Pure inference ("find the gating option in the AST, roll the off-world automatically")
    UNDER-matches: gates hide behind early returns (features/auto_equip.py), helper predicates
    (progressive.py `_flasks_on(world)`), world attributes set in generate_early
    (features/capital.py `gf_capital_reconciler`), and data presence (features/check_lots.py).
    An under-matching checker is itself an inert test -- it would have waved P1 through had the
    gate been written as an early return.
  * A pure prose ledger ("this key is covered, trust me") is the P1 `pass` body wearing a table.
  * So the scan answers only the question it can answer soundly -- "COULD this key legally be
    absent?", where OVER-flagging is safe (worst case: one more verified ledger row) -- and the
    ledger answers the rest, every row mechanically checked against the named test. The two-way
    match (no missing rows, no stale rows) means scanner rot is loud too: if a refactor hides a
    gate from the scan, the key flips to UNCONDITIONAL and its now-stale ledger row fails the run.

WHAT THE SCAN CANNOT SEE (stated, not hidden):
  * A key emitted under a gate by one producer but unconditionally by another counts as
    UNCONDITIONAL -- which is simply true: the unconditional producer emits it on every seed.
  * A gate whose off state emits the key with an EMPTY value (present-but-empty, e.g.
    shopRunePrices, progressionSurfaceLocations) classifies UNCONDITIONAL here; absent-not-empty
    vs present-but-empty is the fixture's jurisdiction (test_gf_slot_data_fixture ALWAYS_KEYS).
  * `core._options_echo` is excluded: it feeds the `options` SUB-dict, whose every subkey is
    echoed unconditionally by design (contract.OPTIONS_SUBKEYS; features never write there).
    🛑 THAT PARENTHETICAL IS A DESIGN INTENT, NOT AN OBSERVATION, and it was FALSE for four days:
    `merchant_bells_on_talk` was declared with `core._options_echo` as its producer and never
    added to the dict, so the option was dark for every seed that set it (#325, 2026-08-10).
    The exclusion is still correct for THIS scan's question -- an unconditional echo cannot leak
    a live value from an off option -- but "is every declared subkey actually there" is a
    different question, and it now has its own gate:
    test_gf_options_echo_covers_its_producers.py. Do not widen this file to cover it; a scan for
    CONDITIONAL emission and a scan for ABSENT emission want opposite defaults.
