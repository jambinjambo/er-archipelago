"""Tier-A COVERAGE GATE test -- the join over an option matrix, asserting a stable baseline.

Two halves:
  * STATIC half (AP-free, runs anywhere in milliseconds, like test_gf_data.py): loads
    coverage.py by file path, runs the full-pool join + a pinned scoped matrix
    (all/base/dlc pools x num_regions 0/3/5 via region_spine.compute_kept), and asserts the
    encoded baseline. Also proves the gate can CATCH a hole (corruption tripwires) and that the
    degradation ledger self-cleans -- a gate that trivially passes is worse than none.
  * LIVE half (WorldTestBase, needs AP + installed worlds.eldenring -- tools/gf_test.py): builds
    real worlds over an option matrix (num_regions PINNED in every config -- the unpinned default
    breaks tests, memory er-test-defaults-numregions) and joins the ACTUALLY EMITTED slot_data.

Baseline THIS tree (post the 2026-07-14 synthetic-award-guard regen -- encode it so a regression
that ADDS an uncovered location fails here). NOTE 2026-07-14: these constants encode the tree AFTER
`build.ps1 -Greenfield` re-runs gen_data with the synthetic award guard (drops the 3 phantom
synthetic rows: flags 177, 320820, 1038457500 -- 4836 -> 4833). Until that regen lands, this file
and the award check are RED on exactly those locations. That red is the gate telling the truth: two
of the three are checks a player can hunt and NEVER obtain. Do not paper over it -- regen.
  * detection / award / region / quarantine violations: **0** in every scope.
  * suppression violations: NONE. BASELINE_SUPPRESSION_APS is empty and must stay empty --
    its 6 debut holes were FIXED on 2026-07-14 (lotItemCategory 0/6 are GOODS; the lot blank was the
    only mechanism that could suppress a farmable ware, and an abstention had closed it).
    check_lots_table.json (EMEVD-award or unjudged lotItemCategory-0/6 rows), whose wares are
    farmable REPEATABLE_GOODS, so features/check_item_flags.py correctly declines id-keyed
    suppression: the vanilla ware double-dips at these checks. They are deliberately NOT in
    coverage_quarantine.ACCEPTED_LEAKS -- they stay visible here until someone decides to either
    fix them (blank via an EMEVD/lot enrichment) or formally accept them.
  * static full pool: 4833 emitted locations (561 shop checks).

#
#   Their wares are FARMABLE goods, so check_item_flags correctly refuses to suppress them by id (it
#   would eat every legitimate copy the player ever picks up). The LOT BLANK was the only mechanism that
#   could ever work for them -- and it was locked behind `_cat == 1` in gen_data plus a "lotItemCategory
#   0 and 6 are ambiguous, NEVER judged" comment. They were never ambiguous; they were never DERIVED.
#   Both categories are GOODS (voted out of ItemLotParam x ITEM_CATALOG). Three suppression mechanisms,
#   and the abstention closed the only door that applied.
#
# So this is now the assertion that the fix STAYS fixed. A new entry here is not bookkeeping -- it is a
# check that hands the player its vanilla ware alongside the Archipelago item, in every seed, silently.
# Fix the mechanism. Do not pin the symptom.
