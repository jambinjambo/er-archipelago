"""scadu_supply -- the blessing's fragment supply must match the cap that was budgeted for it.

THE BUG THIS PINS. `SCADU_INJECTION_TARGET` (was `scaling.SCADU_BLESSING_CAP`) exists to bound an INJECTION (SPEC §9.2: *"Injection
budget. SCADU_CUM[20] = 50 fragments is a lot of filler to displace in a base seed. Cap at 12 (26
fragments) instead?"*). The cap shipped; the injection did not. Measured 2026-08-01 over 40 rolled
seeds at the shipped default `num_regions: 6`, only ONE could reach the cap; the median seed topped
out at blessing 3 of 12. `test_a_rolled_default_seed_reaches_the_cap` is that measurement as a gate.

    `num_regions: 1` produces genuinely one-region seeds (hub + one region, 240-360 locations) for
    the first time -- and on 16 of the 30 possible draws MAX_POOL_SHARE now BINDS: 50 units do not
    fit a 10% share, injection stops short of SCADU_INJECTION_TARGET, and create_items warns. That
    degrade is the design (the clamp's comment has said "a seed this small is already being told,
    loudly, that it cannot reach the target" since it landed); what it must never become is a
    STARVED blessing. This sweeps every possible draw -- deterministic where test_gf_options'
    one_region_dlc fixture is one rolled sample -- and pins the floor: natural + injected always
    reaches at least CLAMP_FLOOR_LEVEL (12, the original shipped cap the 12->20 target raise
    replaced; worst draw today injects 32 units, level 14). Conservative on purpose: feature
    extras (gf_extra_locations) only raise the ceiling, so they are counted as 0 here.

    If this fails, region geometry shrank past the point where the clamp starves the blessing
    below its original cap. That is a premise change -- take it back to a ruling on the
    clamp-vs-floor trade, not a number to relax. (2026-08-25, #1013: it happened -- Enia's 100
    hub rows left and the Abyssal draw fell to 22 units. The ruling landed: the floor is now
