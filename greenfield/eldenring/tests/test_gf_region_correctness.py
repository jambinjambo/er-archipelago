"""Region-of CORRECTNESS gate (tier A: semantic-value, independent oracle).

The existing `test_gf_data.py` proves the region tables are well-FORMED (unique ids, HUB not a
spoke, every region non-empty). It never proves a region assignment is RIGHT. That blind spot is
where three green-while-broken bugs lived (TRIAGE-test-upgrades-20260706.md):
  - gf-maplot-region-quarantine: 52 placed overworld pickups mislabelled to the HUB
    (region_of quarantined them because it keyed on `method` and ignored `flag_source=='map_lot'`).
  - gf-dungeon-grace-misbundle: cave/tower graces bucketed into Limgrave.
  - er-boss-border-grace-skip-list: graces granted that should be skipped.

This gate closes the marquee (map_lot) case with an INDEPENDENT oracle. The ground truth is
`greenfield/region_map.csv` -- gen_data's INPUT, whose `map` / `region` / `flag_source` columns come
straight from the Smithbox `ItemLotParam_map` dump (the item's real placement tile). The bug lived
in `region_of` (the TRANSFORM applied to that input), so checking the emitted assignment against the
CSV's declared placement never re-runs the buggy derivation -- the independence Fable's review
requires (a checker that shares derivation code with the thing it checks is not an oracle).

A placed item (`flag_source=='map_lot'`) physically sits on its tile, so if that tile is a real
emitted spoke its region is ground truth and `region_of` must preserve it -- never quarantine it to
the HUB. That single invariant is the map_lot regression guard.

Deeper layer (follow-up, artifact-gated like ci-linux.sh's DRIFT step): re-derive the tile region
straight from the raw Smithbox param dump / Witchy'ed MSBs / decompiled EMEVD in
`elden_ring_artifacts/` (independent of even region_map.csv), and extend the oracle to graces
(region_graces.py vs grace-anchor map) to cover the dungeon-misbundle + boss-grace-skip cases.

# string covering THREE regions (m11_00/05 Leyndell, m11_10 Roundtable, m11_71 Shunning), and every
# m35 row is mislabelled 'Divine Tower'. gen_data now regions these from the MAP (DUNGEON_REGION_
# OVERRIDE / FLAG_REGION_OVERRIDE / the MSB+EMEVD ground truth in msb_flag_region.tsv), which is
# strictly more authoritative than the coarse string -- and the provenance oracle
# (test_gf_region_provenance_oracle) proves it against the grace join.
