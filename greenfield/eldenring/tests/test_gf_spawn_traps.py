"""Spawn traps -- the resolved catalogue, the id block, and the cross-repo NAME contract.

A spawn trap drops a real enemy on top of the player. That needs THREE game ids, not one -- chr
model, `NpcParam` body, `NpcThinkParam` brain -- so a yaml naming `c4150` has to be RESOLVED, and
this world resolves it at generation time and posts the answer in the item NAME.

🛑 THE FAILURE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR is the same one `test_gf_traps.py` guards, one level meaner.
`er_logic::traps::SpawnSpec::from_item_name` parses `Trap: <label> (<chr>/<npc>/<think> x<count>)`
and REFUSES anything else. Change the format here and nothing breaks: the item still generates, is
still filler, still arrives -- and the client silently refuses it forever. There is no gate across
the repo boundary, so both sides pin the literal and these cases are our half.

The second failure guarded here is quieter still: an AP id that MOVES. Ids are handed out by
`core._SPAWN_TRAP_BASE + chr_id`, deliberately outside `registry.allocate_item_ids`, so that
blessing a new enemy renumbers nothing. If someone "tidies" that into an `enumerate`, every seed
already in flight starts resolving its trap items to the wrong enemy, and every test here still
passes unless one of them is watching the arithmetic itself.

# `worlds.eldenring.*`, which is the INSTALLED world. Had `find_repo_root` ever missed, the four
