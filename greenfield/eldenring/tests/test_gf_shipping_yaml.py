"""The yaml we SHIP must name the game we ship.

Found 2026-07-12 while clearing the release checklist: `release/EldenRing.yaml` -- the flagship
template, the one SETUP.md tells a player to drop into `Players/` -- declared:

    game: EldenRing

but the world is `GAME = "Elden Ring"` (the v0.2 rename). Archipelago rejected it outright:

    Exception: No world found to handle game EldenRing. Did you mean 'Elden Ring' (90% sure)?

So the release bundle did not work out of the box: a player's FIRST action failed. Every doc
(SETUP, CHANGELOG, RELEASE-NOTES) also asserted the id was "unchanged from v0.1", which was the
opposite of the truth and would have sent people hunting for an install problem they did not have.

Nothing caught it because the test suite builds its worlds through the AP test harness, which is handed
the game name directly -- it never reads the shipped yaml. The template was the one artifact with no
test pointing at it, which is exactly why it rotted through a rename.

This test closes that: the shipped yaml's `game:` key must equal the world's GAME, and its options block
must be keyed the same. Cheap, and it fails the moment a rename lands without the template following.

THE OTHER DIRECTION (2026-08-10, and it took a player to find it)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Everything above gates template -> code: no key in the template may be a fake option. Nothing gated
code -> template, so an option could ship for eight releases without ever appearing in the file we
hand players. `capital_reconciler` did exactly that: on by default since v0.2.13, it decides whether
burning the Erdtree permanently strands Royal Leyndell's ~152 checks, and a player who hit that
strand went looking for it, found only `SPEC-capital-reconciler.md` on GitHub, and reported back
that "there no such setting the in he templat so i could find where it was described."

The asymmetry is not an oversight anyone would repeat on purpose -- it is that the wizard's option
list is GENERATED from the option classes and the template is HAND-MAINTAINED, so only the wizard
moves when a feature lands. When three options missed the wizard in the v0.3.9 window the fix was to
re-run the generator, and the changelog entry concluded "The yaml has always accepted these options;
only the wizard was behind." True, and it is the sentence that hid this: a template nobody diffs
against the option surface is behind in a way no player can see, because AP silently ignores what is
missing just as happily as what is invented.

`_TEMPLATE_DEBT` below is the sixteen that were already missing when the gate went in, listed so the
gate can be LIVE while they are drained (#512). It is checked in both directions -- an option
that leaves the template must be added to the list, and one that reaches the template must leave it
-- because a quarantine that may quietly grow is not a gate and one that keeps a fixed entry is a
redundant override.
