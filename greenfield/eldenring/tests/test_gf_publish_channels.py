"""The publish surface: the apworld packer agrees with build.ps1, and the channel ledger is sound.

REPO-ONLY (tools/ + release/ + build.ps1 are not installed beside the world), so this is a
GENERATORS suite with a __main__ entry point.

WHY THE PACKER NEEDS A TEST AT ALL. `tools/build_apworld.py` is a SECOND builder of the same
artifact -- `build.ps1 -Apworld` is the first, and it is the one that cuts releases. Two builders is
two chances to disagree, and the disagreement would be silent: both produce a zip that installs, and

    landing.html is hand-written and has no build step, so its 4,931 sat there through the Enia
    removal and every regen since -- the site told players a number the world had not defined for
    months, and nothing anywhere could notice. This is the same failure the wizard-metadata
    currency gate was written for: a literal that duplicates derived data with no gate between them
    only ever drifts one way.

    The fix is not a build step (a static page on the --site fast path is the point of that page).
    It is a MARKER plus this gate: the number lives in `data-derived="checks-catalogued"`
    attributes, and every one of them must equal the count the world actually defines. Change the
    corpus without changing the page and CI reds, in the `generators` job, before it deploys.

    TWO derivations are asserted equal, not one. wizard/region-census.json's per-region sum and the
    shipped check browser's payload length are built by different tools from the same data; if they
    ever disagree, the page's number is unanswerable and the right outcome is red, not a coin flip.
