"""start_regions -- N opening regions instead of one (features/start_grace.pick_anchor_regions).

MOTIVATING CASE (CONTRIBUTING rule 11). boblerrr, 2026-08-06: "is there an option to start with
more than 1 region unlocked?" There was not: `start_with_region_lock` precollected exactly one
Region Lock and `pick_anchor_region` returned exactly one region.

What this guards, and why each one is here rather than assumed:
  * n == 1 IS THE OLD DRAW -- same region AND the same rng stream afterwards. Every defaulted seed
    in the wild must keep rolling identically, and an extra rng call inside the n == 1 path would
    silently reroll everything downstream of it. region_spine appends GOAL_REGION AFTER its
    rng.sample for exactly this reason; the same discipline applies here.
  * never_extra bars a region from the EXTRAS only, never from the first draw -- filtering the
    first draw would move the anchor of every seed already rolled. A run that opens on the region
    it ends in is not a run, which is why the goal region is passed as never_extra; but the goal
    region is ALSO a gated child today and so cannot anchor at all. The two rules are separate and
    only one of them is testable through the goal region -- see
    test_never_extra_does_not_leak_into_the_first_draw.
  * gated children (region_spine.REGION_PARENT) can never anchor at ANY n: their grace bundle is
    withheld by features/graces, so the player could not warp into one.
  * a pool that cannot supply n fails LOUDLY at both levels -- OptionError from core naming the
    yaml, ValueError from the picker naming the exclusions that bound cannot see.
  * count-neutrality survives n locks leaving the pool, and the goal stops requiring the locks the
    player is already holding.
  * every opening region is fill sphere 0, so the scaling ramp starts from the whole opening rather
    than from one region of it.

Expectations are DERIVED from data.LOCATIONS / region_spine at test time -- no hand-pinned region
sizes to rot when a re-tag moves checks between regions.

PIN num_regions in every world built here -- an unpinned num_regions is a known test-breaker.

        quietly bar the first draw too". Good instinct, unwitnessable subject: GOAL_REGION is
        Leyndell, Leyndell is a REGION_PARENT child (the capital's main gate is a vanilla wall),
        and `pick_anchor_region` drops gated regions from eligibility before it weights anything.
        The count is therefore 0 on every seed and was 0 on the day the guard was written -- an
        assertion that could only ever fail, wearing a failure message blaming a mechanism
        (`never_extra` leaked into the anchor pick) that had nothing to do with it.
