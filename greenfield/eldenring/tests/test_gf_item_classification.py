"""useful/filler comes from the item_categories partition, and this file is the pin on that.

WHAT CHANGED. `core._classify_full` answered "useful or filler?" from the ER FullID high nibble --
goods -> filler, everything else -> useful. That was a SECOND partition of the same 2084 items,
coarser than `item_categories` and living in a different file, so the two could disagree with
nothing to say so. They did: 203 spells, 79 spirit ashes and 37 crystal tears carry the GOODS
nibble, and AP's fill -- plus every partner's client and tracker -- reads them as junk. The nibble
test is gone; `item_categories.CATEGORY_CLASS` is the one table.

THE FLIP HAPPENED (2026-08-12, Alaric's call). `spells`, `spirit_ashes` and `crystal_tears` are
`useful` now. The refactor that split this question out of core shipped as a no-op precisely so this
PR could be the one that moves seeds, on its own, with numbers attached.

So the pin CHANGED SHAPE rather than being deleted. It used to demand agreement with the retired
nibble rule on every catalog name; it now demands the difference be EXACTLY the categories named in
`FLIPPED_TO_USEFUL`, in exactly one direction. That is strictly the stronger assertion -- it still
catches any drift the old one caught, and it additionally catches the exception set growing by
accident, which a loosened "some things are useful now" test would wave through.

🛑 THAT LIST IS HAND-WRITTEN ON PURPOSE and must never be derived from `CATEGORY_CLASS`: a test that
reads its expectation out of the thing under test asserts nothing. `upgrade_bells` joined it on
2026-08-12 -- the smithing economy is not junk.
