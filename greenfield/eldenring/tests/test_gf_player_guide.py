"""The SHIPPED player guide must not name an option that does not exist.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-07-27, and it is embarrassing)
--------------------------------------------------------
There are TWO files called "Player Guide (v0.2)":

    Elden-Ring-Archipelago-Player-Guide.md   repo root -- SHIPPED (package_release.ps1,
                                             required = $true), linked from README and SETUP.md
    release/PLAYER-GUIDE.md             referenced by NOTHING, packaged by NOTHING

They are forked copies that have diverged. I wrote the whole player-facing writeup of the new
difficulty options into the SECOND one -- the one no player ever receives -- and only found out by
being asked "player guide updated for scaling?". Docs had no equivalent of
`test_gf_shipping_yaml`, which exists for exactly this class of mistake one directory over.

So this gates the file that SHIPS:

  1. every option-shaped name it mentions is a real option (a rename leaves the guide describing a
     key Archipelago will silently ignore -- the same silent-ignore hazard, one layer up);
  2. the difficulty options are actually documented there, by name.

(2) is the CONTRIBUTING rule-11 half: the case that motivated the work is the acceptance test. A
generic "names are valid" check would have passed happily on a guide that never mentioned scaling at
all, which is precisely the state this was in.

NOT gated here: whether the two guides agree. Deleting or merging the unshipped duplicate is a call
for Alaric, not a test. It carries a header saying it is not shipped.
