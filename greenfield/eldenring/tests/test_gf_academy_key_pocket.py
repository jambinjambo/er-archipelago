"""The Academy key pocket: its two overworld checks are RAYA LUCARIA region, not Liurnia.

MOTIVATING CASE (rule 11). lavakoala6 (Nexus, 2026-08-04) generated a seed whose spoiler put
`Golden Seed - near Main Academy Gate [f1035467100]` in SPHERE 1; in game the seed sits on the
broken east-bridge span at deck height (world (8972, 313, 11897) -- 75 m ABOVE the East Gate
Bridge Trestle grace below it), inside the Academy crest-warp pocket. Alaric, in game, same day:
"you can't access without academy key (and academy lock in our mod)". Every route into the pocket
is a crest-warp that reads Academy Glintstone Key POSSESSION (key_item_gates.tsv: the game's only
three goods-8109 checks, $Event(1035452600)/(1035462600)/(1036472600)), and the pocket ground is
play-region 14000 -- ACADEMY, not Liurnia 62000 (grace_ground.tsv row for grace 76206). A Liurnia
Lock alone therefore cannot put a player in front of this check, and logic that says otherwise
strands runs -- the same shape as the Isolated Merchant, #252, one tile over.

WHY THIS INVERTS test_the_walked_golden_seed_is_no_longer_barred (2026-08-01). That pin trusted
"WALKED AND CLEARED": a misattribution. On 08-01 the descriptor for f1035467100 read "near Academy
Gate Town" -- an anchor 872 m away and 27th-nearest (corrected 08-02 in location_descriptions.tsv)
-- and the seed actually collected on that walk was f1036447300, the Gate Town seed at lake level
(see its _REGION_CONFIRMED_FLAGS entry). Nobody has stood at f1035467100 without the key.

WHY THE REGION AND NOT A SURFACE BAR (#350). SURFACE_EXCLUDE_APS is consumed by the surface
SELECTION but is absent from core._NO_PROGRESSION_APS, the item_rule fill actually obeys -- a bar
would hide the check from the advertised surface while fill stays free to place progression on it.
The region is the lever that binds: in the Raya Lucaria Academy region the check demands the
Academy lock like every other academy check (er-region-confirmed-is-not-surface-exclude).

The Ash of War f1035467700 (Yura's invasion step; the summon sign stands in the same courtyard
pocket, common 90005774 / entity 1035460700 on m60_35_46) rides the same evidence.

Region is asked as REGION EQUALITY with the in-academy seed f14007990 (near Schoolhouse
Classroom), not as membership -- a check swept into the WRONG region passes membership-shaped
tests while being unobtainable (er-swept-into-the-wrong-region).
