"""The Liurnia Isolated Merchant's 16 checks are RAYA LUCARIA ACADEMY region, not Liurnia -- #252.

MOTIVATING CASE (rule 11). #252: a player hit `Fevor's Cookbook [2] - from Isolated Merchant
[f68220]` holding a Stormveil Lock, on a seed whose spoiler listed it in sphere 1. The merchant
sits behind the Academy Glintstone Key -- Alaric in game, twice: 2026-08-01 "not accessible
without the raya lucaria key", 2026-08-04 "same deal for that merchant ... he's only accessible
once you have academy". His only physical instance stands on the academy island ring
(merchant_shops.tsv: talk 801176000 / entity 32001720, m60_35_45, ~46 m above the lake); the
tile's anchor grace is South Raya Lucaria Gate (76205), a crest-warp destination, and every route
onto the ring is a crest warp reading Academy Glintstone Key POSSESSION (key_item_gates.tsv: the
game's only three goods-8109 checks, one of them $Event(1035452600) in m60_35_45_00 -- this tile).

WHY THE REGION AND NOT THE SURFACE BAR THIS FILE USED TO GUARD (#350). From 2026-08-01 to
2026-08-04 the 16 sat in gen_data._SURFACE_EXCLUDE_FLAGS -- and that instrument DOES NOT BIND
FILL: SURFACE_EXCLUDE_APS is consumed by the surface SELECTION (features/progression_surface)
but is absent from core._NO_PROGRESSION_APS, the item_rule fill actually obeys. Measured on main
2026-08-04: f68220's item_rule accepted a Lock and the check was reachable with the Liurnia Lock
alone -- the bar trimmed the advertisement while fill stayed free to recreate exactly the
stranding #252 reported. The lever that binds is the REGION: in Raya Lucaria Academy the checks
demand the Academy lock chain (REGION_PARENT gates the academy under Liurnia) like every other
academy check, and they may host progression again -- behind the right door.

WHY A DERIVED POPULATION, RATHER THAN TRUSTING THE 16 LITERALS IN gen_data. The gate is on the
MERCHANT: 16 checks sit behind that one door, and the report named one of them. A pin list that
drifts from the merchant's actual stock would re-open the hole silently -- so this re-derives the
population from the committed tables every run and fails if pins and tsv disagree in EITHER
direction (a new row appears unpinned, or a pin goes stale).

🛑 AND THE TRAP THAT MAKES THE DERIVATION LOOK WRONG. All 16 rows list TWO sellers -- the
Isolated Merchant AND the Twin Maiden Husks at the HUB -- which reads as "always reachable,
nothing to fix". It is not: the Twin Maidens only stock a merchant's inventory once you hand them
that merchant's BELL BEARING, which drops from the merchant, behind the same door.
`merchant_shops.tsv` attributes at BLOCK level (#220): it records who CAN open a row, never
whether their stock is unlocked.

Region is asked as REGION EQUALITY with the in-academy seed f14007990 (near Schoolhouse
Classroom), not as membership (er-swept-into-the-wrong-region).
