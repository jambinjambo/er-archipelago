"""A sweep group's TRIGGER must be reachable in the seed that ships the group -- issue #445.

THE MOTIVATING CASE (CONTRIBUTING rule 11), and it is a fixture below, by name.

    boblerrr, 2026-08-07, F6 tracker: `Shadow Keep 124/270`, "all bosses dead except hippo which
    i can't fight". His seed kept Ancient Ruins, Belurat, Cerulean, Charo's, Jagged Peak and Shadow
    Keep. The Golden Hippopotamus's 104-member sweep is a SHADOW KEEP group, but the arena you
    stand in to kill it is PlayRegionParam bucket 69000 = m61_48_45 = SCADU ALTUS, which his seed
    did not keep. `er_logic::region_lock::kick_decision` ejects him before the fight, so the trigger
    could never fire and the group was dead on arrival -- while the client cheerfully rendered
    "Shadow Keep -- 0/104 checks [flag 21000850] -- waiting on the boss".

The July 2026 fix (greenfield/region_overrides.tsv) re-homed the Hippo's DROP to Scadu Altus and
explicitly left the filler SWEEP in Shadow Keep. Re-homing the reward was right. Leaving the sweep
was the unexamined half: a kept region shipped 38% of its checks behind a trigger in a region the
roll may not have kept, and nothing forbade the combination.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. The members are NOT stranded and never were -- measured 2026-08-07:

  * all 201 members of the 6 mismatched groups are ordinary rows in `data.LOCATIONS`, so each one
    is in `locationFlags` for its kept region and is collected by walking to it;
  * 0 of the 201 carry ANY location tag, so none is on any progression surface and
    `confine_foreign_progression` (a share, 100 by default) already refuses another player's advancement
    there -- the same measurement the gesture bar records in gen_data.py;
  * all 87 coordinate-bearing Hippo members sit in m21_00 = bucket 21000 = Shadow Keep ground, and
    all 53 coordinate-bearing Margit members in m10_00/m10_01 = Stormveil ground, so none of them
    stands on the arena's ground either.

So the defect is a LOST CONVENIENCE plus a tracker row that promises something the seed cannot
deliver. That is worth fixing and it is not worth over-fixing: dropping the group is right, deleting
the checks would not be.

# without saying which rows went away and why.
#
# 2026-08-15: 112 -> 170. Not a new datamine -- boss_area_regions.tsv is unchanged. 58 triggers were
# filled from boss_arena_rulings.tsv, Alaric's own arena_region rulings from 2026-08-10 (commit
# 41e8fe7), which until now were consumed ONLY to re-region ambiguous checks and never for the
# arena question they literally answer. Coverage improving is exactly the case this comment says to
# raise for -- leaving the floor at 112 would let all 58 silently disappear again.
# 2026-08-15: 170 -> 192, in two steps. First 170 -> 190. Again not a new datamine. 20 triggers whose ARENA
# MAP carries a first-hand region of its own (dungeon_regions.tsv, source grace/connect) are now
# derived, ranked below both PlayRegionParam and the human rulings.
# 🛑 ALL 20 AGREE with their members' region -- zero new #445 screens, so this is coverage without a
# behaviour change. And tile decode is deliberately excluded: an overworld arena would be regioned by
# the same nearest-neighbour machinery as its members, so the two would agree BY CONSTRUCTION and
# this floor would be measuring a tautology.
# Then 190 -> 192: Alaric ruled the last two by name (Ancestor Spirit m12_08 and Regal
# Ancestor Spirit m12_09, both Siofra River). ALL 26 that remain are the circular
# overworld case -- so this floor is now one short of everything we are willing to claim.
# 2026-08-19 (#877): 192 -> 185 because seven legacy participant/activation triggers ceased to be
# sweeps at all (Deeproot 12030810..13, Gelmir 16000861, Enir Ilim 20010851/52). Their arena
# regions did not become unknown; the bogus triggers were removed and their members redistributed
# among the same fights' terminal flags. The denominator moved 218 -> 211 by the same seven.
# 2026-08-26 (#1066): 185 -> 187. Again not a new datamine -- boss_arena_rulings.tsv gained two HAND
# ROWS for the two triggers J's report exposed (Demi-Human Queen Marigga 2046400800 -> Cerulean,
# Jagged Peak Drake 2049410800 -> Jagged Peak), both carrying Alaric's in-game 2026-08-10 ruling out
# of boss_verdict_tiles.tsv. They were UNAUDITED, which the header above is careful to say is not
# clean: `sweep_trigger_reachable` treated their absent arenas as reachable and the tracker promised
# both groups in every Gravesite seed. The rulings now also decide each boss's HOST region, so the
# pair arrive as ordinary matched groups rather than new #445 screens -- coverage up, split set
# still 0.

        the split a forbidden state rather than measured debt, and both of its causes were fixable
        at the source:
          * 34100800, 11050800 and 11050850 were never real. boss_area_regions.tsv's `region`
            column is a generated SNAPSHOT of the bucket->region spine, and six of its 120 rows had
            not moved with it -- 11050 still filed under Leyndell after the Ashen Capital split,
            34100 still under Limgrave after #202, and two rows naming "Sewer", a region deleted by
            the 2026-08-20 Shunning-Grounds merge. gen_data now re-folds the BUCKET through
            region_groups.py, and all three agree with their members.
          * 2052430800 (Jori) was real, and is the one a player reported. A legacy boss's host
            region ranked the nearest-neighbour tile decode above its MEASURED arena, so the boss
            inherited its members' region by construction. The measured arena now wins; Jori hosts
            Scadu Altus and his five Abyssal checks were re-hosted onto Midra.
