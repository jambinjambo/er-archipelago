def test_the_scaling_TELEMETRY_reports_the_resolved_ceiling_not_the_raw_sentinel():
    """The telemetry line is MACHINE-READ, and nothing was asserting on it.

    `tools/fill_regression.py::_SCALING_RE` parses this exact line and it is the suite's only
    scaling measurement -- `flat_runs` drives the "🛑 a FLAT run means the curve did nothing" alarm.
    So a wrong ceiling here is not a cosmetic log defect: it makes the harness cry wolf on every
    default-curve run (ER-fill-12 is literally the default-curve fixture), and a gate that cries
    wolf is a gate people stop reading.

    THE BUG THIS PINS. `maximum_enemy_difficulty` defaults to `auto` == -1. `ceiling_multiplier`
    clamps its argument to 0..100, so the raw sentinel resolved to the BOTTOM rung and every default
    seed logged `(floor 0, ceiling 0), tiers 0..0`. Live from 55bafb2 (2026-07-30, the auto default)
    until this test.

    WHY THE EXISTING COVERAGE COULD NOT SEE IT. test_a_default_all_regions_seed_spans_the_WHOLE_
    ladder computes its tiers straight off REGION_SPHERE_TARGET_RANGES with no floor/ceiling clamp
    -- it never calls ceiling_multiplier at all. The clamp is applied in exactly one place, the
    telemetry, which is the one place that read the raw option. The suite was green throughout.
