"""AzoTax's no-DLC goal-lock (Discord 2026-08-20): DLC-gated hub shop rows leave a no-DLC seed.

Enia stands in Roundtable Hold -- kept in EVERY seed -- and 36 of her shop rows are gated on DLC
content: the remembrance trades consume a DLC remembrance as their EquipMtrlSetParam material
(the 2,000,000 goods block), and the DLC boss armor sets release on DLC ceremony flags while
selling >=3,000,000 protectors. With `enable_dlc: false` those checks could never open; a
two-player seed on a pre-#860 apworld had a goal-required item parked on one.

2026-08-24 (#1013): Enia's whole shop is VANILLA again -- excluded from randomization -- so the
36 are no longer checks at all and `DLC_GATED_SHOP_CHECK_FLAGS` is EMPTY. That emptiness is
explained, not data loss: every one of the 36 is in `data.NOT_RANDOMIZED` under the
`enia_vanilla` rule. The #913 machinery stays armed: gen_data still derives and emits the RAW
set (`DLC_GATED_SHOP_ROW_FLAGS`). Elden Ring 1.17 adds eight more raw protector rows behind release
flag 6953; their FMG names are not present in the current input bundle, so they are not live shop
checks yet. If any DLC-gated hub row becomes a check, the
core.py per-seed skip has its input back without re-deriving anything.

THE RULE, not the list: the check set must equal the LIVE raw set minus the NOT_RANDOMIZED ledger;
an unnamed raw param row is not a location. No raw-set flag may exist in a no-DLC seed.
