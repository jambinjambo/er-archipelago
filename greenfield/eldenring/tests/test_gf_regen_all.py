"""The regen entrypoint is COMPLETE -- tools/regen_all.py vs. what the tree actually ships.

WHY (issue #699, 2026-08-15). The regen recipe lived in three places -- AGENTS.md section 5a,
`.github/workflows/tests.yaml`, `build.ps1` -- and the one agents are told to read was the
incomplete one: it named no page builder at all, and `tools/build_questline_dag_page.py` appeared
in no doc anywhere. PR #698 followed it exactly and `generators` went red on ONE line, the page's
`inputs_hash` stamp.

Consolidating the list into `tools/regen_all.py` fixes today's failure. It does NOT stop the FIFTH
page being written next month and forgotten the same way -- only a gate does that, and this is it.

WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why each is the thing that would actually have caught #699:

  A. EVERY STAMP-BEARING FILE IN THE TREE IS EMITTED BY A STEP. The defect class is exactly
     "a committed artifact embeds `inputs_hash`, so it re-stales on every data change, and nothing
     regenerates it." So the population is DISCOVERED, not typed: scan the working tree for the
     current stamp and demand each hit be covered by some step's `emits`. A new stamped artifact
     is red on the commit that adds it. 🛑 The scan matches a 16-hex PREFIX, because
     `er-archipelago-questline-dag.html` renders the stamp TRUNCATED -- a full-hash scan silently
     misses the very page that motivated the issue.

  B. EVERY STALENESS-CHECKING tools/build_*.py HAS ALL OF ITS DECLARED OUTPUTS EMITTED BY A STEP.
     This is producer-driven, not location-driven. #708 recurred because the old version knew to
     inspect root HTML pages but could not see greenfield/surface_confidence.tsv or either wizard/
     output. A builder with `--check` is an executable claim that its committed outputs must match;
     the regen entrypoint must be able to make that claim true.

  C. THE STAMP IS WRITTEN BEFORE ANY PAGE IS BUILT. `gen_data.py` writes `_GEN_STAMP`; the pages
     EMBED it. Reordering them is a red CI diff with no visible cause -- it cost six rounds on
     world PR #481, so it is pinned rather than remembered.

  D. THE CONSUMERS CITE THE ENTRYPOINT AND ENUMERATE NO PAGE. `build.ps1`, `tests.yaml` and
     AGENTS.md must invoke `regen_all.py`, and none of them may run a PAGE builder directly.
     This is the assertion that keeps "three lists" from growing back.

  E. Every step names a file that exists (no stale row), and phases are declared/ordered.

REPO-ONLY: it reads `tools/`, `build.ps1` and `.github/`, none of which gf_test.py installs beside
the world. Ledgered in tools/gf_suite_ledger.py under GENERATORS.
