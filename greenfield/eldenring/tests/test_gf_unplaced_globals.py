"""Issue #249 -- the unplaced common-event rows that were never checks, so their item stayed vanilla.

Reported in game: Thops still dropped the vanilla Academy Glintstone Staff while his Bell Bearing
from the same corpse was randomized. A `region_map.csv` row filed `Global / Common-event
(unplaced)` got no location, `check_lots` never blanked the vanilla lot, and nothing errored.

The general derivation still refuses flags with no single-map evidence.  The first-hand #249 report
is the evidence for the narrow f400361 GLOBAL_RECOVER pin, and the acceptance test below now requires
that motivating case to remain a real Raya Lucaria Academy check.

# you is the arena-grace lesson, one table over).
# 36 -> 52 (2026-08-07): the de-dup re-key (see test_coverage_gate BASELINE_TOTAL_LOCATIONS)
# unblocked 62 rows the name rule had been discarding; 16 of them had derivable tiles.
# 52 -> 51 (2026-08-07, #451): the ONE sanctioned way this floor may drop -- a row was RETIRED as
# cut content, not lost to a corpus going quiet. FromSoft writes the marker BOTH ways, bare
# '[ERROR]' and '[ERROR]<real name>', and the guard tested only the bare form; goods 8130
# ("[ERROR]Rya's Necklace", sortId 0) therefore read as a NAMED item and f400081 shipped as a live
# check holding a thing that does not exist. It was never a duplicate of f400300 (goods 8136, the
# real necklace, sortId 204050) -- it was never an item at all. Every corpus this emit reads is
# intact and every other row is unchanged: 51 of 51 survive, and the only delta is
#     -400081  m35_00_00_00  talk_esd  Rya's Necklace
# 🛑 This is the shape the docstring above warns about, so the burden is discharged by SAYING WHICH
# ROW and WHY it is not a real placement -- never by moving the number to whatever the emit printed.
