"""The wizard's seed-size census must be CURRENT, CONSISTENT, and TRUE OF REAL SEEDS.

`tools/build_region_census.py` emits `wizard/region-census.json`: per region, how many checks it
contributes and -- keyed by class COMBINATION -- how many of those may host progression. The options
wizard evaluates it live so a player can size a seed BEFORE generating one.

MOTIVATING CASE (CONTRIBUTING rule 11). On 2026-08-07 a Nexus commenter asked what fraction of
"2000 checks for 6 areas" is filler before committing five friends to a multiworld, and the day
before, bobler asked why `num_regions: 1` kept four regions. Neither answer existed until after
generation. #409 added the gen-log line that explains the kept set -- but a log line is read AFTER
the decision it would have informed. The census puts the number in front of the choice, and this
file is what stops it being a confidently wrong number.

Four claims, each a different way the artifact could rot:

1. THE COMMITTED COPIES AGREE (`test_inlined_blob_equals_the_json_file`). The census is stored twice
   -- the JSON file and the blob inlined into `wizard/wizard.html`. Same split, same failure mode,
   as `test_gf_wizard_blob_sync`: four commits in 2026-07-28/29 moved the options JSON without
   re-injecting and the wizard page silently lost three options.

2. NEITHER COPY IS STALE (`test_artifact_is_current`). A regen that moves a region's check count or
   re-anchors a Golden Seed must not land silently.

3. 🛑 THE SPLIT SUMS BACK TO THE GATED TOTAL (`test_default_union_matches_surface_confidence`).
   This is the load-bearing one. The census adds a REGION axis to numbers `build_surface_confidence`
   already owns; if the split drifts, the wizard prints confident per-seed surface sizes that no
   longer describe the surface. So the union of this table over the default classes is pinned to
   that tool's own `default_hosting` total. It is a UNION, never a sum of per-class counts: surface
   classes overlap (a check is routinely GreatRune + MajorBoss + Boss), so summing double-counts
   exactly the checks carrying two selected classes -- which is why the artifact is keyed by
   combination in the first place.

4. 🛑 THE IDENTITY IS TRUE OF WORLDS ARCHIPELAGO ACTUALLY BUILDS
   (`test_check_count_identity_against_real_worlds`). Everything above is internal consistency --
   the census could be perfectly self-consistent and still describe a seed shape that does not
   exist. So this builds real worlds and asserts

       len(real locations) == hub + sum(kept regions) + finale

   where `finale` is the Ashen Capital's checks and exists iff a base-game region is in play
   (features/finale.finale_active). The Ashen Capital is NEVER rollable, is not in REGIONS and is
   not counted by num_regions, so a census that treated it as an ordinary region would be off by 12
   on every base-game seed and off by -12 on every dlc_only one. The matrix below covers both.

REPO-ONLY (`find_repo_root`): `tools/` and `wizard/` are not copied into the pinned AP checkout by
`tools/gf_test.py`, so under that harness there is nothing to test. Claims 1-3 are AP-free; claim 4
additionally needs AP, so it runs where an AP checkout sits inside the repo (`.ap-test`, which is
what `run_ci.ps1` / `greenfield/ci-linux.sh` provision) -- the same arrangement
`test_gf_surface_confidence`'s second suite relies on.
