"""Boss-sweep SCOPING gate (tier A): the 2026-07-08 class-scoped sweep model must hold.

gen_data.py scopes each boss's dungeon-sweep by the boss's CLASS (from the authoritative
DisplayBossHealthBar set, tools/datamine_boss_healthbars.py -> BOSS_HEALTHBARS):
  * legacy / interior (region majors)   -> region filler PARTITIONED round-robin among the region's
                                           legacy bosses (each boss gets a disjoint ~1/N slice; a
                                           single-legacy-boss region still gets the whole pool)
  * catacomb / cave / tunnel (m30/31/32)-> MAP-LOCAL (only that dungeon map's own checks)
  * field / overworld (m60)             -> NEIGHBORHOOD + FILLER-ONLY (2026-07-15): each overworld
                                           filler check goes to the NEAREST same-region field boss
                                           within Chebyshev tile distance 2, ties split round-robin;
                                           groups are pairwise DISJOINT

These are the invariants a regen (or a member-loop / classifier change) must not break. Independent
of gen_data's derivation: we read the emitted modules + region_map.csv and re-derive each member's
map straight from its flag, so a bug in the generator can't hide behind shared code.
