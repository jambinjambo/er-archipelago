"""The param-diff guard that has to work exactly once, months from now, on a day nobody planned for.

`tools/diff_gen_inputs.py` exists for game-patch day: re-dump the regulation with Smithbox, recompile
`gen_inputs.db`, and find out what moved. Most of its output is informational, but ONE branch is
load-bearing -- the watched-id guard, which fires when an id we have built runtime behaviour on gains
a reference it did not have before.

That matters because we REPURPOSE vanilla `SpEffectParam` rows: we rewrite their fields at runtime and
apply them to the player (`no_equip_load` 20012080, `no_fall_damage` 20010827, `scadu_blessing`
20012081). Each was claimed on the evidence that it occurs exactly once across all 239 param tables --
as its own row, referenced by nothing. If a patch adds a reference, we would be silently overwriting a
row the game reads, and the symptom is a balance bug in one area weeks later rather than a crash.

🛑 NO CORPUS REACHES THAT BRANCH. There is no patched regulation in the repo to diff against, so the
guard would sit unexercised until the exact moment it is needed
(`guard-absent-from-corpus-needs-a-direct-call`). These tests build synthetic bundles in memory and
call it directly -- including a MUTATION that plants a reference to a claimed row and asserts the tool
notices and exits non-zero.
