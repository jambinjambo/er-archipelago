"""#1054's acceptance test: the PlayArea scan's ten ground-placed movers, and the Yelough NO-OP.

THE MOTIVATING CASES.

1. YELOUGH ANIX TUNNEL IS CONSECRATED SNOWFIELD (Alaric's WIKI ruling, 2026-08-26). The #1054
   queue carried 19 Yelough-anchored rows as Mountaintops-vs-Consecrated-Snowfield candidates.
   The PlayArea scan answers `none` for every one of them -- no volume, no seam, no
   PlayRegionParam tile default -- so the instrument CANNOT settle them in either direction, and
   Alaric ruled them from the wiki instead.

   🛑 EVIDENCE CLASS: WIKI RULING. Not scan evidence. Never cite it as scan evidence.

   🛑 AND THE RULING WAS ALREADY SATISFIED IN THE SHIPPED DATA. Grace 73211 files under
   play_region 65002 (grace_region_map.tsv); 65002 is Consecrated Snowfield in
   region_groups.REGION_GROUPS; its measured ground bucket is 32110 (grace_ground.tsv,
   `tile-default`, m60_47_55), which PLAY_REGION_GROUPS also owns for Consecrated Snowfield; 73211
   already sits in the Consecrated Snowfield grace bundle; and every Yelough-labelled check in
   data.py already ships Consecrated Snowfield. The Mountaintops premise came from the STALE
   `our_region` column in check_region_second_opinion.tsv, built before the regen that moved them
   (#1054 records the same staleness for check_region_triage.tsv). A NOTE IS NOT STATE -- so this
   file is where the ruling becomes state, and a regression that flips 73211 back to Mountaintops
   fails a written decision instead of passing silently.

2. THE TEN MOVERS. 679 checks carry an EXACT (`volume:`/`interior-vol:`/`seam:`/`interior-seam:`)
   answer in item_play_regions.tsv; 114 disagree with the region they shipped. Only these ten are
   BOTH scan-exact AND ground-placed pickups -- the population the instrument rules on. The
   NPC-relocation families in #1054 are deliberately excluded (a shop/grant flag's scanned point
   is where the NPC ENDED UP, not where the check is), and this file pins two of them as NOT
   moved so a future bulk apply trips here.

   Two of the five Rauh movers go the OTHER way from 255's report (#1046). That asymmetry is the
   point: a queue that only ever moved rows in the reported direction would be the instrument
   agreeing with the reporter instead of measuring.
