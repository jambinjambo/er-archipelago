"""A check must STAND on ground its seed lets the player walk to -- the second half of issue #445.

THE MECHANISM, and it is two derivations that had never been made to agree:

  * `core._add_locations` walks `[HUB] + kept` and CREATES a location for every check whose ASSIGNED
    region is kept. That assignment comes from the check's flag / map / MSB attribution.
  * `er_logic::region_lock::kick_decision` ejects the player from any play_region bucket whose
    region is not kept. That comparison is made against the player's POSITION.

Where a check's assigned region and its position's region differ, a seed can create a location it
also forbids you to reach: created, flag-polled, counted on the tracker, uncollectable.

FOUND WHILE VERIFYING #445 (2026-08-07). That issue is about a sweep TRIGGER standing in the wrong
region; this is the same shape one level down, on ordinary checks. It surfaced because 8 members of
the Gravesite sweep (2046450800) turned out to sit on Rauh Base ground -- so a seed keeping Gravesite
without Rauh Base does not merely lose that sweep's convenience, it ships checks behind the kick.

WHAT THIS TEST IS. A RATCHET, not a clean bill. It opened with 20 pinned mismatches and 1 ambiguous
tile; the pinned list may only ever SHRINK, and it reached ZERO on 2026-08-26 -- see the note on
KNOWN_MISMATCHES for how each row left, because "the pin is empty" is a claim that has to say which
verdicts it rests on. An empty pin is still not a clean bill: the audit
measures under half the corpus (2284 checks are UNMEASURED, below), so it means "nothing the join
can currently see", never "nothing is wrong".

🛑 AND IT MEASURES LESS THAN HALF THE CORPUS. 2451 of 4916 checks resolve; the other 2465 have no
coordinate or sit on a tile with no play_region row. `test_ground_audit_coverage_is_stated_out_loud`
warns on a GREEN run, because a self-reported coverage number is not a safeguard unless something
acts on it (CONTRIBUTING rule 11) and this one is the reason the pinned set is a floor.

# (event_flag, assigned_region, ground_region). NOT a benign list: each is an open question about
# which of the two regions is right, and all four look like a genuinely wrong ASSIGNMENT rather than
# a reachability bug -- "Mohgwyn :: Festering Bloody Finger - near The First Step" is a Mohgwyn
# invasion item that is picked up in Limgrave, and "Limgrave :: Hefty Cracked Pot - near Bonny Gaol"
# is a DLC gaol check filed under Limgrave. Resolve them one at a time, in game, and delete the row
# when it is settled. Adding a row here is not a fix.
#
# ⭐ SHRANK 20 -> 4 on 2026-08-09, and the reason is a DERIVATION, not a re-pin. All sixteen rows
# that left were the same defect: a check on an overworld tile with NO GRACE of its own, whose region
# ANCHOR/ANCHOR61 had nearest-neighboured onto whichever neighbour happened to hold one, while
# play_region_buckets.tsv -- the table er_logic's own kick_decision reads -- carried a row for that
# exact tile. gen_data.TILE_ROW_REGION now consults it (below the tile's own grace, above the hop),
# so the ASSIGNMENT moved onto the ground instead of the pin being deleted:
#     m61_47_39  7 checks  Cerulean  -> Charo's                    (the Nexus report, f530855)
#     m61_46_45 13 checks  Gravesite -> Rauh Base   (11 of them pinned; the #445 sweep members)
#     m60_48_51  2 checks  Altus     -> Mountaintops of the Giants
# The four that remain are NOT of that class: each sits on a tile whose region was never in doubt,
# so no tile fix can move them and only an in-game verdict can. See test_gf_tile_row_region.py.
#
# 🛑 KEYED ON THE EVENT FLAG, NOT THE ap-id. ap-ids are positional: the 2026-08-07 regen added 16
# checks and renumbered every id above 7774000, so an ap-id pin would have gone on passing while
# naming different checks. Flags are game data and do not move. (CONTRIBUTING: "whenever two
# components exchange ids, name the SPACE in the type, the key, or the comment -- and assert it.")
KNOWN_MISMATCHES = set()
# EMPTIED 2026-08-26, and an empty pin is NOT a clean bill -- the audit still measures under half
# the corpus (see the coverage warning below), so this is "nothing the join can currently see",
# not "nothing is wrong". The two rows left as follows, and neither left by being re-pinned:
#
#   (400175, "Farum Azula", "Caelid") -- the INPUT changed under it. It was pinned when its only
#   datamined coordinate was m60_52_38 (Caelid, tile-default bucket 64000), so the join could see
#   nothing but Caelid ground for a Farum Azula check. main's full-census coordinate refresh
#   (76c107e0, "updated item_grace_coords") gave the flag SIX more sites, one of which is
#   m13_00_00_00 -- Crumbling Farum Azula itself, bucket 13000, PLAY_REGION_GROUPS["Farum Azula"].
#   The disjunct-site rule (any site's ground matching suffices) now resolves it to AGREE. The
#   attribution was right all along; the corpus simply could not witness it.
#
#   (400349, "Roundtable Hold", "Limgrave") -- the same story, same commit. Pinned as D's quest
#   family, assigned to the HUB where the handover happens and datamined only at his m60_44_39
#   field station. The refresh added m11_10_00_00 (bucket 11100 = Roundtable Hold), i.e. the Hold
#   itself, so the assigned region is now among its grounds and the row AGREES.
#
# The two mismatches that same refresh CREATED were adjudicated in the same pass rather than
# pinned, which is what the test below demands:
#
#   (400036, "Mohgwyn", "Limgrave") -- assignment UPHELD, excused as SWEEP-ANCHORED. The refresh
#   measured a previously no_coord flag and the only coordinates it has are two placements of the
#   shared lot 110301 on Bloody-Finger invader NPCs (m60_35_44, m60_42_36); the award site is
#   Mohg's own m12_05 EMEVD grant, which has no MSB coordinate at all. f400036 is a member of
#   Mohg's sweep (trigger 12050800, SWEEP_ARENA_REGION "Mohgwyn"), so a Mohgwyn seed obtains it by
#   killing him -- and since #1059 made member/arena co-region a GATE, moving it onto the accusing
#   ground would BREAK test_gf_sweep_region_containment. The ruling is written out in
#   tools/check_ground_regions.RULED_SWEEP_ANCHORS[12050800].
#
#   (400220, "Roundtable Hold", "Stormveil") -- assignment WRONG, attribution fixed. The Hold was
#   never derived for this flag (legacy region_map row: map=PENDING, method=global_filler; the
#   name still said "(region unconfirmed)"; location_descriptions.tsv records that Alaric's
#   2026-08-04 pass over all 43 Golden Seeds left this one blank). Its only lot, 112200, is placed
#   on three MSB enemies -- m10_00 (Stormveil, bucket 10000) and the play_region-less Limgrave
#   tiles m60_45_38 / m60_46_36 -- none of them in the Hold. Because the HUB is in scope in every
#   seed, the Hold filing CREATED the check unconditionally while its only witnessed ground sat
#   behind the Stormveil lock: the #680 shape. gen_data.FLAG_REGION_OVERRIDE[400220] now files it
#   Stormveil, with the reason in region_overrides.tsv.
#
# 🛑 THE PROTOCOL IS UNCHANGED: a new mismatch is FIXED or RULED, never appended here. If this set
# is ever non-empty again, each row is an open question with a name on it.

# EMPTIED 2026-08-19: 2047457180's region flipped Scadu Altus -> Gravesite in the full-census
# regen (one of nine ground-truth corrections), and Gravesite is one of its m61_47_44 tile's two
# bucket regions -- the record now AGREES instead of straddling. The set stays declared so the

# two buckets, two regions; a tile-level join must not guess at a 3-D volume).
