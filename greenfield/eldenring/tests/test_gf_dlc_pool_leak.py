"""DLC pool-leak regression -- DLC items must never enter a DLC-off seed's pool (WorldTestBase, needs AP).

Guards the fix for the 2026-07-06 leak (seed "GFShatter", enable_dlc:false): region gating sealed DLC
*regions*, but the pool-AUGMENTATION paths (pool_builder juice, core varied filler, filler_foreign)
drew from the full ITEM_CATALOG / FILLER_POOL -- which is built from BASE **and** DLC FMG name tables --
so DLC gear/spells/remembrances flooded in as juice/filler regardless of enable_dlc.

The fix publishes world.gf_dlc_excluded (== DLC_ITEM_NAMES when DLC off, else empty) and the three
augmentation consumers drop it. These tests run the exact leaky option combo (item_shuffle +
pool_builder max + varied_filler) with DLC off and assert the resulting itempool is DLC-clean, plus
directly exercise the two solo-visible gate helpers and confirm the gate is inert when DLC is on.

importorskips when AP isn't importable (source-tree sandbox). Also skips (module-level) when
DLC_ITEM_NAMES is not yet generated -- i.e. before patch_greenfield_dlc_leak.py is applied and
gen_data.py has been re-run -- so a pre-patch CI run is a clean skip, not a collection error.

Run (from the Archipelago dir, world installed, AFTER apply + gen_data.py):
    python -m pytest worlds/eldenring/tests/test_gf_dlc_pool_leak.py
