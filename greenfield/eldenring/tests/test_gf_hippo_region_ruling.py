"""#885's acceptance test: the Golden Hippopotamus presents as Scadu Altus EVERYWHERE.

THE MOTIVATING CASE (cokeman5 on #330, 2026-08-18, the third player-facing surfacing): *"the tracker
says I am missing the golden hippopotamus sweep, but the golden hippopotamus' boss room counts as
part of Scadu Altus, not Shadow Keep."* Worse than the label: a player holding the Shadow Keep Lock
without Scadu Altus, shown 100+ `Shadow Keep ::` rows "also granted by Golden Hippopotamus",
reasonably goes to kill the Hippo -- and the kick guard ejects them from the arena's play_region
(bucket 69000), which their seed never opened. Scadu Altus alone, by contrast, always suffices for
every one of those rows: the fight is fought standing in Scadu Altus and the kill sweeps them all.

THE RULING (Alaric 2026-08-19, #885): reward, sweep trigger, sweep grouping, AND every granted
member present as Scadu Altus. Implemented as gen_data.DUNGEON_REGION_CURATED["m21_00_00_00"];
this file asserts each surface so no regen or branch reorder can silently split them apart again
(#53/#146/#445 are the history of exactly that).

The one deliberate carve-out is asserted too: f68800, the m21_00 cookbook the Hippo does NOT grant,
stays Shadow Keep -- Scadu-Altus-labelled with no sweep route it would be a created-but-kick-locked
check in a Scadu-Altus-only seed (see FLAG_REGION_OVERRIDE[68800]).
