"""progression_surface -- CONFINE this world's own progression to a small, high-confidence location
set (v0.2; matt-style "important locations" restriction, not a soft weight).

matt's standalone ER randomizer HARD-RESTRICTS key items to an "important locations" whitelist (major
bosses always, plus opt-in golden-seed trees / sacred-tear churches / shops / other bosses); a separate
"bias slider" only tunes difficulty WITHIN that set. The bedrock AP port only got the SOFT half (mark
PRIORITY, advancement gets first crack -- features/curated_fill here). This feature adds the HARD half:
it pulls this world's OWN progression out of the pool and places it, via Fill.fill_restrictive, ONTO the
selected surface only -- default = MajorBoss (the ~24 boss_arena arena majors + the hand-picked
MAJOR_BOSS_EXTRAS, tagged 'MajorBoss' in location_tags). Everything else lands normally.

WHAT COUNTS AS "OUR PROGRESSION": the region Locks (the region-lock spine's gate items) plus any
conditionally-progression items -- required Great Runes (great_runes goal), Leyndell-gate runes, legacy
dungeon keys. Boss Keys are DELIBERATELY EXEMPT: with boss_keys on there are ~24 of them, they'd swamp
the tiny surface, and features/boss_locks already keeps them reachable in logic. Ability Unlocks
(ability_unlocks_required) are ALSO exempt, for the opposite reason: they are made progression precisely
so the GENERAL fill can carry them into partner worlds -- confining them here would keep them home and
kill the cross-game dependency that is their entire purpose.

FEASIBILITY LADDER (never FillError): a surface smaller than the number of locks to place -- or a seed
with no sphere-0 anchor -- can't host every lock. So strict mode WIDENS the allowed surface one grouped
rung at a time, highest-confidence first (MajorBoss -> +Remembrance,GreatRune -> +KeyItem -> +Boss ->
+Legendary -> +Seedtree,Church) and,
for anything still unplaced, RETURNS it to the pool for normal fill. Because the terminal action is
"back to the pool", generation can never hard-fail from this feature: worst case it degrades to v0.1
scatter. (The +Seedtree rung also unlocks the 2 Roundtable-Hold Golden Seeds, an always-reachable
sphere-0 bootstrap, so a no-precollect seed can still seed the lock chain.)

BASE-STATE FIX: reachability during the pre-fill is evaluated from mw.get_all_state(False) AFTER the
restricted items are pulled -- so the rest of the pool (Boss Keys, foreign advancement, any precollected
region Lock) counts as available, and a Boss-Key-gated boss check doesn't look falsely unreachable.
Placed locks are collected (lock=True) so multiworld progression-balancing can't later move them off the
surface. Runs from core.pre_fill; supersedes curated_fill when the mode is soft/strict.

    🛑 NO COUNT HERE ON PURPOSE. This said "193 locations" until 2026-08-02, when the surface that

    merchant). That is the same mistake missable_barred_aps was written to fix for the missable set,
    and it came back because the number lived in prose. It also MOVES -- every in-game region
    confirmation changes it (re-anchoring two Liurnia Golden Seeds shifted the default 154 -> 156 in
    a single commit). So the count lives in ONE place, regenerated and drift-gated:

        greenfield/surface_confidence.tsv   (tools/build_surface_confidence.py)

    which prices every class: tagged, how many each bar costs it, and how many can host. Quote that
    file, never a number typed into a docstring.

    ShopSlot is AT MOST one slot per merchant, never every shop row: a merchant enters the pool once,
    so however large their stock they can hold at most one progression item and cannot dominate the
    surface by breadth. The pinned slot is a ware that merchant ALONE sells (one stock flag game-wide,
    so the location is unambiguous), stocked from the start and with a resolved region; merchants with
    no such ware are skipped at regen (location_tags.SHOP_SLOT_SKIPS lists them with reasons). Use
    `Shop`/`ShopNonSpell` instead if you actually want a merchant-heavy seed -- be aware that is
    roughly three quarters of the surface (see surface_confidence.tsv) and the game becomes "farm

#
#   1. THE KEYS DO NOT NAME WHAT THEY SELECT. `Church` is not "church locations", it is the 13 Sacred
#      Tears; `Basin` is Crystal Tears; `Seedtree` is Golden Seeds. A player ticking `Church`
#      reasonably believed they were opening up churches. Worse, the SAME concept had two names in two
#      adjacent fields of the same page: Crystal Tears are `Basin` here and `crystal_tears` in
#      keep_local / exclude_local_item_only.
#   2. ALPHABETICAL SCATTERED THE FAMILIES. Boss / FieldBoss / LegacyBoss / MajorBoss landed in four
#      separate places in the grid, and the three Shop classes in three.
#   3. THE GRID HID THE LATTICE. Most of these classes CONTAIN each other (see class_containment),
#      so ticking a broad class silently makes narrower boxes no-ops -- with no signal at all.
#
# Renaming the KEYS is a compat break: AP 0.6.7 Options.py `VerifyKeys.verify_keys` RAISES OptionError
# on an unknown key, so every yaml in the wild saying `Church` would HARD-FAIL generation, not
# silently drop. So the keys stay and the LABEL is the fix; renaming them (with the old names kept as
# deprecated aliases) is a separate, deliberate change.

    is on the surface is the question we are answering.

    # WHY ONE PER SWEEP, and not all of them

    MEASURED 2026-08-13, one ER slot + DOOM 1993, num_regions 4: a default seed's sweeps grant
    **924 of its 1517 locations (60.9%)**, against a surface of 30 (2.0%). Admitting every member
    would take the surface to ~63% of the seed -- which does fix the intake collapse #631 is about,
    and makes "confined to the surface" mean almost nothing, which is the promise the option exists
    to keep. One member per trigger is 55 here and 218 full-map: it roughly DOUBLES the surface
    without diluting it.

    This is ShopSlot's argument, deliberately: "a merchant enters the pool once, so however large
    their stock they can hold at most one progression item and cannot dominate the surface by
    breadth." A sweep is the same shape -- a trigger with a large membership -- and gets the same
    treatment.

    # WHICH member

    The lowest ap-id NOT already on the tag surface (`tag_ids`), falling back to the lowest overall.
    Two reasons it is not a random draw: `world.random` is consumed a different number of times
    depending on how hard fill works, so drawing here would move the seed for everything downstream
    (the reason `_confine_draw` is a hash); and the choice must be reproducible from the multidata
    for the tracker to star the same check the fill used. Skipping the tag surface matters because
    the six SURFACE-CUTTABLE classes are still in the pre-cut member lists, so a naive `min()` can
    nominate a check the surface already had -- adding a name and no breadth.

    🛑 Reads `boss_locks.rung_sweeps`, NOT `enabled_sweeps`. The latter applies the per-seed surface
    cut, which reads the surface, which is this function -- a cycle. `rung_sweeps` reads only

    Ring world's surface, in ONE pass, and spill whatever does not fit back into the pool.

    # Why this is not an item_rule (er-archipelago#491)

    The first version barred a released Lock from our own non-surface checks and let the general
    fill place it. It worked -- 42-48% travel in a two-slot multiworld with ~90% of Locks still on
    curated checks -- and it had NO SPILL. `apply()` is documented "Never FillErrors" because
    confined Locks get the feasibility ladder AND the return-to-pool valve; a bare item_rule has
    neither, so a seed whose surface is too small simply fails. Three configurations found it --
    a narrowed surface, `num_regions: 1`, and a shifted filler pool -- each missed by a different
    threshold, because capacity is not the constraint: REACHABLE capacity in sphere order is, and no
    count of open slots can see it. A real fill can, because it just tries.

    # Why `stage_pre_fill` and not `pre_fill`

    🛑 `AutoWorld.call_all` walks `multiworld.player_ids` IN PLAYER ORDER, so placing into another
    player's locations from our own `pre_fill` would give player 1 first pick of everyone's surface
    and player 2 the leftovers -- curation that depends on slot number. It is also out of spec:
    TUNIC's own `stage_pre_fill` raises with "caused by another world filling TUNIC locations during
    pre_fill... we cannot recover from this issue." `stage_pre_fill` is the sanctioned hook -- a
    classmethod run ONCE for the whole multiworld, after every per-world `pre_fill` -- and TUNIC uses
    it for this exact shape, gathering items and locations across every slot of its own game.

    🛑 Unlike TUNIC's, our items are PROGRESSION, not filler, so this cannot be a `place_locked_item`
    loop: it needs `fill_restrictive` with a real state, the way `_place` already does.

    # Cross-game (#703)

    Cross-game USED to be deliberately untouched: this hook saw only Elden Ring worlds, and a Lock
    bound for a partner was one it did not place -- it spilled to the general fill. That was the
    design, and the measurement says the valve never opened: our surfaces host ~170 checks against
    at most ~36 Locks, so nothing ever spilled. **0 Locks reached a Hollow Knight slot across four
    configurations**, including a 2xER + 1xHK seed where 15 of 28 Locks travelled and every one went
    to the other Elden Ring world.

    So `cross_game_progression` routes a share of the eligible progression at partner locations
    FIRST, before the ER surfaces get a look. `auto` is 1/n_games -- half in a two-game seed.

    #811: that set used to be `gf_released_lock_items`, so despite the option's name the pass could
    see Region Locks and NOTHING ELSE. Required Great Runes were advancement, but `apply()` removed
    them first and locked them onto their owner's surface. The pass now reads
    `gf_released_progression_items`: released Locks plus every non-Lock advancement item whenever
    this world has a non-zero cross-game share. The remainder still falls through to the same ER
    surface pass, preserving curation and reachability.

    ⚠️ THIS FILLS ANOTHER GAME'S LOCATIONS, which is exactly what the note above warns about: TUNIC
    raises "caused by another world filling TUNIC locations during pre_fill" and cannot recover.
    Three things keep that as narrow as possible -- only EMPTY, unlocked locations are offered, the
    fill is partial so nothing is forced, and the whole pass is caught so our failure can never be
    the thing that breaks a generation. It is still a real risk with a game that objects on
    principle, and `cross_game_progression: 0` is the escape hatch.

    # 🛑 WHY THIS IS FOUR NUMBERS AND NOT TWO, AND WHY IT RUNS SO LATE

    The first version answered a much narrower question -- "of the items apply()'s surface pass
    placed, how many are on a boss" -- and reported **0 on a boss, 0 elsewhere** on every seed of a
    five-seed batch while the finished multiworld had **400 of 400 progression items sitting on
    Elden Ring bosses**. Two independent reasons, and each alone was enough:

      1. `is_restricted_progression` is deliberately OWN-ONLY (it is the predicate that decides what
         we confine). But the multiworld half of `boss_progression` is about OTHER players' keys
         landing on our bosses, and every one of those 400 was foreign. The census could not see the
         thing the option is mostly for.
      2. `apply()` runs from `core.pre_fill`, BEFORE the main fill. At `progression_bias: 0` every
         Lock is released to the pool first, so the surface pass has nothing of its own left to
         place and correctly reported zero -- of a population that was empty at the time of asking.

    A telemetry line that reads "this feature did nothing" while the feature is working is worse than
    no line: it invites someone to go fix what is not broken, and it hides the real degrade when one
    arrives. So the question changed to the one a player would ask, and the measurement moved to
    where it has a true answer -- `core.generate_output`, which Main.py runs at line 239, AFTER
    `balance_multiworld_progression` at 206. post_fill would have been earlier and wrong in the same
    family of way: balancing SWAPS placed items between arbitrary players' locations, so a count
    taken before it describes a seed nobody will play.

    Boss Keys stay excluded (`is_restricted_progression`'s rule) because they are exempt from the

    OTHER gate keys. In vanilla-progression mode the full vanilla dependency graph (deep compound / count
    chokepoints, ~30 keys) makes that a routine multi-region cycle -> keys stranded behind their own
