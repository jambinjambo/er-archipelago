"""progression_surface -- CONFINE this world's own progression to a small, high-confidence location
set (v0.2; matt-style "important locations" restriction, not a soft weight).

matt's standalone ER randomizer HARD-RESTRICTS key items to an "important locations" whitelist (major
bosses always, plus opt-in golden-seed trees / sacred-tear churches / shops / other bosses); a separate
"bias slider" only tunes difficulty WITHIN that set. The bedrock AP port only got the SOFT half (mark
PRIORITY, advancement gets first crack -- features/curated_fill here). This feature adds the HARD half:
it pulls this world's OWN progression out of the pool and places it, via Fill.fill_restrictive, ONTO the
selected surface only -- default = MajorBoss (the ~24 boss_arena arena majors + the hand-picked
MAJOR_BOSS_EXTRAS, tagged 'MajorBoss' in location_tags). Everything else lands normally.

WHAT COUNTS AS "OUR PROGRESSION": the region Locks (the region-lock spine's gate items) plus any
conditionally-progression items -- required Great Runes (great_runes goal), Leyndell-gate runes, legacy
dungeon keys. Boss Keys are DELIBERATELY EXEMPT: with boss_keys on there are ~24 of them, they'd swamp
the tiny surface, and features/boss_locks already keeps them reachable in logic.

FEASIBILITY LADDER (never FillError): a surface smaller than the number of locks to place -- or a seed
with no sphere-0 anchor -- can't host every lock. So strict mode WIDENS the allowed surface one grouped
rung at a time, highest-confidence first (MajorBoss -> +Remembrance,GreatRune -> +KeyItem -> +Boss ->
+Legendary -> +Seedtree,Church) and,
for anything still unplaced, RETURNS it to the pool for normal fill. Because the terminal action is
"back to the pool", generation can never hard-fail from this feature: worst case it degrades to v0.1
scatter. (The +Seedtree rung also unlocks the 2 Roundtable-Hold Golden Seeds, an always-reachable
sphere-0 bootstrap, so a no-precollect seed can still seed the lock chain.)

BASE-STATE FIX: reachability during the pre-fill is evaluated from mw.get_all_state(False) AFTER the
restricted items are pulled -- so the rest of the pool (Boss Keys, foreign advancement, any precollected
region Lock) counts as available, and a Boss-Key-gated boss check doesn't look falsely unreachable.
Placed locks are collected (lock=True) so multiworld progression-balancing can't later move them off the
surface. Runs from core.pre_fill; supersedes curated_fill when the mode is soft/strict.

    🛑 NO COUNT HERE ON PURPOSE. This said "193 locations" until 2026-08-02, when the surface that
    could actually HOST an item was 156. 193 was a TAG count: it never subtracted the checks barred
    from carrying progression (guessed region, missable, erdtree-burn, surface-excluded, hub
    merchant). That is the same mistake missable_barred_aps was written to fix for the missable set,
    and it came back because the number lived in prose. It also MOVES -- every in-game region
    confirmation changes it (re-anchoring two Liurnia Golden Seeds shifted the default 154 -> 156 in
    a single commit). So the count lives in ONE place, regenerated and drift-gated:

        greenfield/surface_confidence.tsv   (tools/build_surface_confidence.py)

    which prices every class: tagged, how many each bar costs it, and how many can host. Quote that
    file, never a number typed into a docstring.

    ShopSlot is AT MOST one slot per merchant, never every shop row: a merchant enters the pool once,
    so however large their stock they can hold at most one progression item and cannot dominate the
    surface by breadth. The pinned slot is a ware that merchant ALONE sells (one stock flag game-wide,
    so the location is unambiguous), stocked from the start and with a resolved region; merchants with
    no such ware are skipped at regen (location_tags.SHOP_SLOT_SKIPS lists them with reasons). Use
    `Shop`/`ShopNonSpell` instead if you actually want a merchant-heavy seed -- be aware that is
    roughly three quarters of the surface (see surface_confidence.tsv) and the game becomes "farm
    runes, buy your progression".

    Narrowing is safe: the feasibility ladder widens automatically rather than failing to generate, and
    an EMPTY set turns the confinement off entirely (progression scatters as vanilla AP fill decides).

    Ring slot can host it, it goes into the open pool and may land anywhere.

    Above 0, that share is FORCED OUT of your world entirely: those Locks may not be placed in your

#      Tears; `Basin` is Crystal Tears; `Seedtree` is Golden Seeds. A player ticking `Church`
#      reasonably believed they were opening up churches. Worse, the SAME concept had two names in two
#      adjacent fields of the same page: Crystal Tears are `Basin` here and `crystal_tears` in
#      keep_local / exclude_local_item_only.
#   2. ALPHABETICAL SCATTERED THE FAMILIES. Boss / FieldBoss / LegacyBoss / MajorBoss landed in four
#      separate places in the grid, and the three Shop classes in three.
#   3. THE GRID HID THE LATTICE. Most of these classes CONTAIN each other (see class_containment),
#      so ticking a broad class silently makes narrower boxes no-ops -- with no signal at all.
#
# Renaming the KEYS is a compat break: AP 0.6.7 Options.py `VerifyKeys.verify_keys` RAISES OptionError
# on an unknown key, so every yaml in the wild saying `Church` would HARD-FAIL generation, not

    world's surface, in ONE pass, and spill whatever does not fit back into the pool.

    # Why this is not an item_rule (er-archipelago#491)

    The first version barred a released Lock from our own non-surface checks and let the general
    fill place it. It worked -- 42-48% travel in a two-slot multiworld with ~90% of Locks still on
    curated checks -- and it had NO SPILL. `apply()` is documented "Never FillErrors" because
    confined Locks get the feasibility ladder AND the return-to-pool valve; a bare item_rule has
    neither, so a seed whose surface is too small simply fails. Three configurations found it --
    a narrowed surface, `num_regions: 1`, and a shifted filler pool -- each missed by a different
    threshold, because capacity is not the constraint: REACHABLE capacity in sphere order is, and no
    count of open slots can see it. A real fill can, because it just tries.

    # Why `stage_pre_fill` and not `pre_fill`

    🛑 `AutoWorld.call_all` walks `multiworld.player_ids` IN PLAYER ORDER, so placing into another
    player's locations from our own `pre_fill` would give player 1 first pick of everyone's surface
    and player 2 the leftovers -- curation that depends on slot number. It is also out of spec:
    TUNIC's own `stage_pre_fill` raises with "caused by another world filling TUNIC locations during
    pre_fill... we cannot recover from this issue." `stage_pre_fill` is the sanctioned hook -- a
    classmethod run ONCE for the whole multiworld, after every per-world `pre_fill` -- and TUNIC uses
    it for this exact shape, gathering items and locations across every slot of its own game.

    🛑 Unlike TUNIC's, our items are PROGRESSION, not filler, so this cannot be a `place_locked_item`
    loop: it needs `fill_restrictive` with a real state, the way `_place` already does.

    Cross-game is deliberately untouched. This hook only sees Elden Ring worlds, so a Lock bound for
    a Hollow Knight slot is simply one this pass did not place -- it spills, and the general fill
    takes it anywhere. Curated among ourselves, ordinary everywhere else.

    # 🛑 A RELEASED LOCK IS NEVER OFFERED BACK TO ITS OWN WORLD (2026-08-15)

    That sentence above -- "curated among ourselves" -- quietly assumed a multi-Elden-Ring
    multiworld. With ONE Elden Ring slot beside partner games, "somebody's surface" is our own
    surface, it always has room, and the spill is zero. MEASURED, five four-slot seeds against stock
    AP 0.6.7 (2 Elden Ring + 2 Hollow Knight), progression_bias 0:

        progression surface: 6 Lock(s) RELEASED to the multiworld pool (progression_bias 0)
        progression surface: placed 6/6 RELEASED Lock(s) across 1 Elden Ring world(s); 0 SPILLED

    Zero of 16 released Locks reached a partner world in the whole batch, while `ProgressionBias`'s
    docstring promised the opposite in plain language. So the release was real and the travel was
    not: we handed the Lock back to ourselves and called it released.

    The fix is one rule, installed on the gathered locations for the duration of this pass and torn
    down in `finally`: a location REFUSES an item belonging to its own player. With two Elden Ring
    slots that still curates -- A's Locks onto B's surface and back -- which is what the pass is for.
    With one, every candidate refuses every item, `allow_partial` returns them all unplaced, and the
    spill path below (which already existed, and is already what the "never FillErrors" contract
    rests on) hands them to the general fill, where AP's sphere-driven progression fill can put them
    in ANY player's world. Partner games demonstrably accept them: in that same batch Hollow Knight
    hosted 196 progression items.

    locked, or no reachable filler slot remains) -- so a salvageable seed ships instead of dying, and a
    genuinely unwinnable one fails loudly at generation instead of hours into a playthrough. Catches
    any residual boss-key/region-lock cycle or stranded rune/legacy key, whatever minted it. FAIL-OPEN

        "your region Locks are somewhere in here", which `progression_bias` retires: at the default
        of 0 none of your Locks are reserved for YOUR surface, so on a two-slot seed roughly half of
        them are sitting on somebody else's.

        It still confines real progression, so the honest reading is the weaker one:
        **these are the locations that can host progression items -- yours or another world's.**
        `confine_foreign_progression` keeps that share of every OTHER player's advancement on
        exactly this set, and whatever share of your own Locks you chose to keep curated lands here
        too. A star is "something important can be here", not "your key is here". 🛑 At a confine
        share below 100 the star weakens once more: the un-confined share of foreign progression can
        sit on any reachable check of yours, starred or not.

        It REPLACES `bigTicketLocations`, which was a second list of "important checks" naming a set
        progression could never reach: big-ticket targeted {MajorBoss, Remembrance, GreatRune} while
        the surface is {Remembrance, Seedtree, Church, Boss, Fragment, Revered} -- intersection
        Remembrance alone. The client was starring MajorBoss/GreatRune checks that this module FORBIDS
        a region Lock from ever occupying. A tracker pointing at checks the locks cannot be on is worse
        than no tracker: it teaches the player something false.

        Emitting the surface itself makes that drift unrepresentable -- "where progression may be"
        and "what the client stars" are now one expression, evaluated once.
