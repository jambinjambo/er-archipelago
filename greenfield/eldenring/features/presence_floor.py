"""presence_floor -- a curated QoL "presence floor": guarantee a set of high-value Wondrous Physick
crystal tears and smithing bell bearings are ALWAYS in the item pool, by injecting exactly one copy of
each roster item that is ABSENT this seed (its home-region vanilla check was not kept), and NEVER
duplicating one that is already present.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`dlc_only` (and any num_regions seed that seals a roster item's home region) drops the vanilla checks
that pay out these tears / bell bearings, so a DLC-only run could never obtain a single physick tear or
smithing-stone bell bearing -- the flask and the upgrade economy would feel amputated even though the
mode is supposed to stand on its own. The presence floor makes the mode feel like its own thing: the
curated QoL set is guaranteed present regardless of which regions survive.

HOW IT STAYS COUNT-NEUTRAL
--------------------------
Modelled on features/progressive.py exactly. create_items() returns one pool item per ABSENT roster
name; core.create_items adds these to the pool BEFORE it sizes the filler tail (slots =
total_locations - len(pool)), so every injected copy displaces exactly one filler/Rune tail item and
the pool stays count-exact. The injected copies are `useful` (never progression -- Region Locks stay
the sole gate, so winnability is unaffected).

PRESENCE, NOT DUPLICATION
-------------------------
A roster item is PRESENT when its vanilla item lands on a kept location this seed (item_shuffle reads
LOCATION_ITEM for [HUB] + kept regions -- the same source core uses to build its item-shuffle pool). A
present roster item is NOT injected; features/filler_curation protects the whole roster from junk
seizure (PRESENCE_FLOOR_ITEMS), so a present tear/bell survives in the pool as ITSELF rather than being
displaced by the filler tail. Absent => inject exactly one copy. So: present xor injected, never both,
never duplicated.

The roster items are real vanilla GOODS (granted by their FullID, already in ITEM_CATALOG /
_AP_IDS_TO_ITEM_IDS), so the client grants them with no client change -- this feature is pool-only.

A ROSTER ITEM ANOTHER FEATURE HAS TAKEN OVER (#539)
---------------------------------------------------
`progressive_stone_bells` replaces every vanilla bell bearing with a progressive ladder and
substitutes the vanilla names out of the item-shuffle pool (features/progressive.vanilla_
substitutions). This floor is the OTHER source of those names, and it is the reason all eight showed
up in a live seed even where only a few regions were kept: substitution only removes the bearings
that were ON a kept check, and the floor injected every one that was not. Injecting a vanilla bearing
under that toggle hands the player the ladder's TOP RUNG as a single pickup -- the ladder is then not
degraded, it is BYPASSED (boblerrr, live playtest 2026-08-10). So when the toggle is on the bell
bearings drop out of the floor (_toggle_dropped below).

That is a HAND-OFF, not a hole: this floor exists so `dlc_only` / region-sealed seeds are not left
with no bell bearing at all, and features/progressive keeps exactly that guarantee by topping its
copies up to the ladder length in EVERY seed (bell_inject_count), including the ones with zero kept
bell checks. The physick tears have no such owner and are untouched.
