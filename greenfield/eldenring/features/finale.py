"""THE FINALE -- the Ashen Capital / Elden Throne, entered by ITEM (SPEC-ashen-capital-lock).

Godfrey (Hoarah Loux, f510070), the Elden Beast (f510230), Sir Gideon Ofnir (f510060) and the seven
m11_05 map lots (incl. [Incantation] Erdtree Heal f11057000 and Erdtree's Favor +2 f11057100) used
to be excluded as "ashen_capital_dead: post-Erdtree-burn content, unreachable". That was a
conditional truth wearing a blanket exclusion (ruling 2026-07-14): the Ashen Capital is reachable
exactly when the player can burn the Erdtree, and the burn's trigger is game data --
common.emevd $Event(900) waits solely on flag 9116 (Maliketh dead, set only by m13_00 = Crumbling
Farum Azula), then warps into m11_05; m19_00 (Elden Throne) is entered only through m11_05's burnt
Erdtree. gen_data._finale_derive re-derives all of it from the artifacts on every regen.

⭐ 2026-08-06, SPEC-ashen-capital-lock. The paragraph above is history: the burn is no longer
game data we wait on, it is an ITEM we mint. Pure-runtime means flag 9116 (and, as the probe
found, flag 300 -- without which the Elden Beast's arena is a VOID) are ours to write, so the
Erdtree burn became one synthetic progression item, `Ashen Capital Lock`. That single change
retires the whole conditional apparatus:

  * the finale EXISTS on every seed with the BASE GAME in play -- no force-kept regions, no
    `num_regions: 1` quietly producing four. `data.FINALE_REQUIRES` is now `()` and stays that
    way; `finale_active` asks about the base game, not about a prerequisite set.
  * the region hangs off the HUB (`data.FINALE_HOST_REGION` = Roundtable Hold) behind
    `has("Ashen Capital Lock")`. You reach the Ashen Capital by warping to its OWN graces, never
    through the capital's rune gate -- so Leyndell is not on the way and is not required.
  * the Ashen Capital is still NEVER ROLLABLE: not in REGIONS, never drawn by `num_regions`,
    never counted in the kept set, never the precollected start anchor. It is ten checks and a
    gauntlet, not a place you play (Alaric, 2026-08-06). `describe_kept` is untouched.
  * it now owns its geometry outright -- play_regions 11050 + 19000 and grace bundle
    71122-71125 moved out of Leyndell in region_groups.py -- so the client's kick enforces the
    Ashen lock in its own right. `core._lockless_host` is gone with that change.

NATURAL PROGRESSION is the one mode that keeps the old shape, because it mints no Lock items at
all and so has no item to arm the burn with. There the VANILLA chain is the only burn there is,
and the finale exists iff the burn region (Maliketh) and the map owner are both kept, entered on
those two region events. `finale_requirement_locks` is the single place that difference lives.

Historic per-seed rule (this feature), kept because the tests still name it:
  * count-neutrality: core counts this feature's locations via world.gf_extra_locations and this
    feature contributes exactly one pool item per location (the vanilla ware under item_shuffle,
    filler otherwise) -- items == locations holds by construction.
  * detection: core merges world.gf_extra_location_flags into slot_data locationFlags, so the
    client's flag poll sees the finale flags; all ten are ItemLotParam-awarded (check_lots_table
    map/items), so award + suppression ride the existing static machinery.
  * the goal: when the finale exists it IS the goal (features/goal_locations.py tier 0), and
    since 2026-08-06 `goal: auto` resolves to the Elden Beast on every base-game seed. The finale
    is a fixed gauntlet -- Gideon into Godfrey/Hoarah Loux into Radagon/Elden Beast -- and that
    shape plays well as a capstone under rando no matter what the draw kept (Alaric, decision 3).

Telemetry (CONTRIBUTING: a feature is armed, or it says why not): logs armed-with-N or
inert-because-X once per generation.

    # It is withheld now and GRANTED BY THE CLIENT once every other goal item is held
