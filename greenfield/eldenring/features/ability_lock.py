"""Ability lock (#945, SPEC-ability-lock-mode) -- the apworld half.

The client disables the chosen abilities at the game's LOGICAL action layer
(`CSChrActionRequestModule.disabled_action_inputs`), which is keybind- and device-agnostic and
never touches menus (see the client's ability_lock.rs).

TWO MODES, one set (`locked_abilities`):

* STATIC (the opt-out) -- the abilities are off for the whole seed. Pure client behaviour: no item,
  no check, no pool. The set rides `slot_data["options"]["locked_abilities"]` (emitted centrally by
  `core._options_echo`), read by `er-logic/options.rs parse_ability_lock`.

* PROGRESSIVE (#980, THE DEFAULT since 2026-08-25) -- the same abilities start locked, but each
  becomes a SYNTHETIC 'Unlock: X' item shuffled into the pool; finding it unlocks that ability
  (`er_logic ability_lock::unlock`). This IS a pool contribution: `create_items` mints one useful
  item per locked ability (count-exact, displacing filler like every other contributor), and
  `slot_data` ships the per-seed `abilityUnlockItems` {item_id: ability} map plus
  `requiresClientFeatures: ["ability_unlock"]` -- the armorBundles pattern exactly. The item ids
  are registered at a fixed base in core.py; the client never grants them, it resolves them
  through the map.

WHY THE ITEMS ARE core-REGISTERED, NOT `ITEMS =` HERE. `registry.allocate_item_ids` hands feature
ITEMS sequential ids, so seven names here would renumber every later feature's items. core.py mints
them at contract.ABILITY_UNLOCK_ITEM_BASE instead (the spawn-trap lesson); this module only decides
WHICH get pooled and emits the map.

GOAL-REQUIRED BY DEFAULT. Under `ability_unlocks_required` (a DefaultOnToggle) the pooled unlocks
are `progression` and are ANDed into the goal's held-item requirement; turn it off and they fall
back to `useful`, never gating completion. Either way nothing in region/check logic depends on an
ability, so a seed is always traversable -- the requirement is a held-item gate at the goal, not a
reachability one.

ONE ATTACK COMES EARLY WHEN ALL FOUR ATTACK INPUTS ARE LOCKED (#1035). A great many checks are
kill-gated -- boss defeats, enemy drops, every defeat-flag sweep trigger -- and logic knows nothing
about the locked set, so a seed that locks r1+r2+l1+l2 can expect kills the player cannot perform.
`create_items` therefore declares `Unlock: R1` to `early_items` in exactly that case, the same seam
Roll uses. Spells are NOT a way out and get no carve-out (Alaric, 2026-08-25: "spells don't count,
you need an L or R button to cast a spell") -- a staff or seal casts on an attack button. Fewer than
four locked forces nothing: an unlocked attack input is a damage source from the start.

`crouch -> l3` is the one unverified action map (er-logic). `heal` is lockable too, but by a
different mechanism: the client re-applies the No Flask SpEffect while it is locked (the flask
heals nothing), since heal owns no action bit.

class LockedAbilities(OptionSet):
    """ABILITIES THE GAME DISABLES. Each named ability is turned off at the character's logical-action
    layer, so the lock survives key/pad rebinds, covers keyboard and mouse, and never affects menus.

    Valid names: jump, crouch, roll, r1, r2, l1, l2, heal. (r1/r2/l1/l2 are the attack inputs; locking
    one also stops casting through it, since a staff or seal casts on the attack button. `heal` locks
    the flask -- it heals nothing while locked -- via the No Flask SpEffect, not an action mask.)
    Empty = nothing locked, the default.

    🛑 crouch is the one UNVERIFIED action: ER has no dedicated crouch action, so the client routes it
    to the stick-click (l3) as a first guess. If a playtest shows that is wrong, the fix is one line
    in er-logic, not here.

    Locking ALL FOUR attack inputs (r1, r2, l1, l2) in Progressive mode leaves you unable to damage
    anything, and a great many checks are kill-gated -- so that seed forces one attack unlock
    ("Unlock: R1") into an early sphere, wherever in the multiworld it lands. Spells do not count as
    an attack for this: a staff or seal casts on an attack button, so a caster with all four locked
    is just as weaponless. Locking three or fewer forces nothing -- you still have an attack.

    Ability Lock Mode decides whether these start off and are unlocked by items you find
    (Progressive, the default) or stay off for the whole seed (Static, the opt-out).

    Unlocks Required) -- so a partner holding your "Unlock: Roll" genuinely blocks your goal, which

    never gate completion. Needs a client that understands ability unlocks (declared via
    requiresClientFeatures); older clients would leave the abilities locked, so they are told to
    upgrade rather than play it half-supported.

    distributed across the whole multiworld, your abilities can land in a PARTNER's world -- and then
    you cannot complete until they send them back. That mutual dependency is the point of playing in
    an Archipelago rather than solo.
