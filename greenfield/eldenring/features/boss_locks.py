"""SPEC-PARITY Phase 3 -- region bosses (+ future dungeon sweeps).

Region bosses: the 25 major bosses (method=boss_arena) joined to greenfield ap-ids by FLAG,
pre-generated into boss_data.py (matt-free). Emitted as bossLocations {region: [ap_ids]} for kept
regions -- the data a boss-based ending goal / region-boss tracker reads.

Dungeon SWEEPS (kill a dungeon boss -> auto-grant its other checks) need a per-dungeon boss-kill
flag the backbone does NOT carry: only 22/39 minidungeons have any emevd row, and those aren't
reliably boss rewards. That trigger set requires an EMEVD enrichment pass (SPEC-PARITY.md P3); the boss-defeat FLAG per dungeon is now derived from the DarkScript EMEVD (boss_sweeps.py) and
emitted as dungeonSweepFlags {boss_flag: [member_ap_ids]}; a small client flag-watch handler
(P3b-client) grants the members on boss kill. The location-keyed dungeonSweeps variant additionally
needs a boss-reward-location join (ItemLotParam) and stays empty for now.

    WHY THIS IS PER SEED AND NOT BAKED. Until 2026-08-13 gen_data cut the whole 16-class vocabulary,
    so a sweep was "filler-only" in the narrow sense of "holds nothing the surface could ever name".
    That is a corpus-wide answer to a per-seed question: `Legendary` and `Basin` are not in
    SURFACE_DEFAULT_CLASSES at all, so in a default seed those 51 checks were barred from a sweep to
    protect a placement that could not happen. The rule now matches what the seed actually decided --
    a class that cannot host progression here is ordinary area loot, and killing the boss pays it out.

    🛑 THE HONEST EDGE, stated rather than special-cased. An EMPTY surface turns confinement off
    entirely (progression scatters as vanilla AP fill decides) and this cut correctly returns
    nothing -- but that is not a hole this change opens. With no confinement, our own Locks and, at
    `confine_foreign_progression` 0, foreign advancement can already land on any of the 3731
    UNTAGGED filler members a sweep has always granted. The surface is the only statement a seed
    makes about where progression may go; when it says "nowhere in particular" there is nothing for
    a tag cut to act on, and DungeonSweep's docstring says so.

    ⚠️ progression_surface's feasibility LADDER can widen past the player's selection when the
    surface is too small to host every Lock (a few-region seed). If it reaches its +Legendary or
    +Seedtree,Church rung it can place a Lock on a check this cut has already released, and the
    sweep will hand it over. Not a soft-lock -- a sweep member's access rule is its region, so the
    Lock was reachable there anyway and the sweep only makes it earlier -- but it is the one way a
    sweep can pay out progression under a non-empty surface, and it is why this returns the BASE
    selection rather than pretending to predict the ladder.

    🛑 `full_area_sweeps` TURNS THIS OFF ENTIRELY (#1033, siffrin + bobler). It is checked HERE
    rather than in `enabled_sweeps` so that every reader of the cut agrees about what this seed
    grants -- a cut that two callers disagree about is the defect `enabled_sweeps` was written to
    prevent. When the option is on the cut is empty, the six cuttable classes stay in the payload
    whatever the surface says, and the honest edge above stops being an edge and becomes the
    behaviour: a boss kill CAN hand over this seed's own Locks, and at the default
    `confine_foreign_progression` another player's. That is not a soft-lock for the same reason the
    ladder case is not -- a sweep member's access rule is its own region and the trigger boss stands
    in a region this seed kept (#445) -- so the sweep only makes a reachable check arrive earlier.

    all -- those plus legacy dungeons and castles (~2614).
    bosses (default) -- those plus FIELD bosses, i.e. everything (~3876).

    Those are the BAKED pools. What a seed grants is that minus its Progression Surface cut below;
    at the default surface, ~3782 at the widest rung.

    🛑 UNTIL 2026-07-29 THESE THREE WERE THE SAME THING. The emit gated on `value != 0` and never
    filtered by class, so minidungeons/all/bosses each granted the full 3197 -- the ladder in this
    docstring described behaviour that had never been implemented, and the player guide and the
    v0.2.15 release notes repeated it. The rungs are real now.

    The DEFAULT moved 'all' -> 'bosses' at the same time, and that is not a behaviour change: the
    full set is what every non-none value already granted, so 'bosses' IS what shipped. Leaving the
    default at 'all' would have quietly dropped field sweeps (1213 checks, 38%) from every seed
    under the banner of a bug fix.

    A sweep never hands you another boss's reward, a Remembrance, a Great Rune, a key item or a
    merchant's stock: those are cut when the sweep is built and no option restores them.

    Everything else in the area is yours, INCLUDING the good stuff -- Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears,
    Scadutree Fragments, Revered Spirit Ashes, Crystal Tears and the legendaries (2026-08-13; it was
    filler-only before, +145 checks corpus-wide). The exception is the classes YOU put on the
    Progression Surface: those are where this seed places its Locks, so they are taken back out of
    the sweep, per seed. At the default surface that means Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Scadutree
    Fragments and Revered Ashes stay where they lie and the legendaries and Crystal Tears sweep;
    untick a collectathon line on the surface and the sweep picks it up instead.

    🛑 ONE SWEEP MEMBER PER TRIGGER CAN NOW HOLD PROGRESSION, in a default seed (2026-08-13). The
    default Progression Surface includes `SweepSlot`, which nominates a single member of every sweep
    you run as somewhere a key item may be placed -- so killing a boss can hand you one. That is the
    only class the surface does NOT take back out of the sweep, and deliberately: taking it back
    would delete the check it just nominated. Drop `SweepSlot` from progression_surface if you would
    rather a sweep never pay out progression -- or see `full_area_sweeps` for the opposite ask,
    every check in the area including the progression; the cost of dropping it is that at the default
    `confine_foreign_progression` another player's key items have only ~30 checks of yours to land
    on, and most of them stop arriving (er-archipelago#631).

    🛑 With an EMPTY Progression Surface there is no confinement at all, so progression scatters
    wherever AP's fill puts it -- including onto ordinary sweep members, as it always could. The cut
    can only act on a surface that says something.

    A group is only sent to a seed that can actually FIRE it (issue #445): the trigger boss's ARENA
    region has to be kept too, not just the region its members live in. Six groups are fought
    somewhere other than where their loot lies -- the Golden Hippopotamus hands over 104 Shadow Keep
    checks from Scadu Altus ground -- and a seed that keeps one region without the other used to
    ship a sweep whose boss the region lock would not let the player reach. Those groups are dropped
    instead. The checks are unaffected: every member is an ordinary pickup in its own region, so what
    is lost is the convenience, not the loot.

    its key items: at the default surface that is Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Scadutree Fragments
    and Revered Spirit Ashes, and you still walk to those yourself.

    on -- nothing is taken back out. Every check the sweep holds is granted the moment the boss
    dies, progression included, so killing a boss can hand you a region Lock (or, at the default
    `confine_foreign_progression`, another player's item). That is the point of the option, not a
    side effect: it is what "killing the boss gives me the area" actually means. It cannot strand
    you -- a sweep only ever grants checks in a region you kept and behind a boss you could reach,
    so it makes a reachable check arrive earlier and never makes an unreachable one required.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, in any seed. This widens WHICH checks a sweep pays; it does not widen

    * another boss's reward, remembrance or Great Rune -- handing those over would delete the fight;

    Nor can it reach a check whose position was never recovered from the game data: those belong to
    no boss's area, so no boss kill can grant them. Requested by siffrin and bobler (#1033).

    Missable checks are unaffected by this option in either direction -- they have always been
    ordinary sweep members (170 of the 289 are swept today), so a sweep already rescues most of
    them and this changes nothing about which. `protect_missable_locations` is the option for that.

      REGION_BOSSES, route that sweep to the Boss Key of the boss it actually belongs to. This is
      the derivable per-boss precision: the sweep flag and the boss-defeat flag are the same event
      flag, so the join needs no extra data. Today only Rennala's m14 flag (14000800) aligns; the
      set grows automatically as the EMEVD-enrichment regen makes more boss_data defeat flags equal
      their dungeon's sweep trigger.

    * REPRESENTATIVE fallback (the documented coarsening GAP) -- when the sweep trigger flag is NOT
      a known boss-defeat flag (no per-boss join derivable), route to the region's FIRST Boss Key.
      Multi-boss regions therefore coarsen to one key. This is sound for the CLIENT deferral hint:
      an over-broad representative key just delays a client grant. (Note: sweep members ARE now
      logic-gated behind their key -- key_gate_map/set_rules, 2026-07-08 -- so the representative
      coarsening also decides WHICH key a member logic-defers on; that only ever gates on a key
      reachable no later than the precise one, and progression_surface precollects lock-hosting keys,
      so it cannot soft-lock or overload fill.) The precise branch drops in once the flags align.

    Pure over its inputs (module globals by default) so it unit-tests with synthetic data injected."""
