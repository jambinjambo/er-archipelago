"""THE filler tail has ONE owner.

Before this module, three passes each owned a slice of the same resource and had no contract with
each other:

  1. pool_builder (additive, PASS 1) -- frozen at scope=all_filler / intensity=max / cap=0, it
     converted essentially the WHOLE junk-consumable larder into `useful` juice gear.
  2. filler_curation.curate (in-place swap, PASS 2) -- ran AFTER, and selected candidates that are
     junk-consumable AND not useful. pool_builder had just marked the larder useful. So curate()
     found an empty larder and the yaml's `curated_filler: {stones: 20, ...}` recipe delivered ~3
     items out of an entitlement of ~534.
  3. core.post_fill stone_ramp -- measured its stone deficit against what was already placed,
     concluded supply was adequate, and no-op'd.

Each pass was locally correct. The composition put a live playtest in fill-sphere 2 holding a +0
weapon, and NOTHING RAISED. The passes had been defending against each other by hand for months --
`displaceable_filler` existed only so two of them couldn't drift, pool_builder force-classified its
own output `useful` so the others wouldn't seize it back, and PoolBuilderScope's docstring shipped a
warning that its own aggressive setting "can thin the stone/rune economy that stone_ramp draws from".
Passes that need classification bits, shared predicates and docstring warnings to avoid eating each
other are one mechanism wearing three coats.

So: ONE pass, ONE budget, ONE arbitration point.

    partition  -> every tail slot the seed has to spend (rune-fallback checks + displaceable junk),
                  minus what the other contributors (locks, boss keys, progressive) already ate.
    allocate   -> the recipe, applied ONCE. Economy categories (stones, somber_stones, runes) are a
                  RESERVATION taken off the top and are never scaled down. Everything else splits the
                  remainder by weight. `juice` is a category like any other -- it no longer has a
                  private budget.
    materialize-> core writes the plan into the tail slots. There is no second pass to undo it.

The starvation is now UNREPRESENTABLE rather than merely fixed: a budget too small to pay the economy
reservation RAISES at generation instead of shipping a +0-weapon seed. Nothing in this module exits a
loop early and shrugs -- every shortfall either raises or warns by name (CONTRIBUTING: a degraded pass
must announce itself; the old `while _deficit > 0 and _li < len(_locs)` silently running out of slots
is exactly how the bug survived).

Guarded by tests/test_gf_filler_economy_floor.py, which asserts against the COMPOSED default pipeline
-- because a pass tested in isolation structurally cannot see this class of bug. Six
test_gf_pool_builder_*.py files and a filler_curation suite were all green while the seed was broken.

# not a derivation -- it is the one judgment constant in this module, and it is deliberately a single

# reached spheres 0-1 (CI cleared it by a hair; Alaric's box did not, 2026-07-13).

# `early_stone_floor` above is a claim about SUPPLY: the seed HOLDS enough stones. It only lands them
# early by accident -- on a small seed spheres 0-1 are most of the world, so nearly everything is
# early; at a large num_regions they are a thin slice and the same reservation delivers ~nothing up
# front, silently. (That accident is exactly what the 4-region test was quietly relying on.)

# So we also DECLARE the early stones to AP: `multiworld.local_early_items`, which Fill honours by
# placing them in locations reachable from the START state. That is a statement of INTENT -- we never
# look at a sphere, and fill still chooses the location. (Reading spheres and second-guessing fill is
# what made the deleted stone_ramp both wrong and unfixable.) It degrades rather than explodes: Fill

#
# THE MARGIN (Alaric, 2026-07-13): guarantee TWICE the ladder cost, not the COLLECTION_RATE-inflated
# floor. The floor's 4x inflation exists because a stone lying somewhere in the seed might never be
# found; a guaranteed-early stone only has to be found in the START REGION, so a 2x margin -- "you
# need to pick up half of them" -- is the honest number. 12 regular stones, not 24.

# against the promise this module makes. That was invisible until `num_regions: 1` could finally
# keep ONE region: before SPEC-ashen-capital-lock the auto goal force-kept Leyndell and its parent
# closure added Altus, so the smallest real seed was three or four regions and the proportional
# share always happened to clear the need. On a genuine one-region seed it does not, and
# SomberTierPresenceFloor caught it: tiers absent from the pool entirely, and the early guarantee
# short by one copy of Somber [1..3].
#
# A thin REGULAR-stone economy is a pacing problem and degrades with a warning, which is right. A
# missing somber TIER is a WALL -- a somber weapon can never pass the level below it, in that seed,
# ever -- and this module's own doctrine is that starvation should be unrepresentable and that the
# cost is asymmetric, so round up. 12 slots out of a 46-130 slot one-region tail is affordable, so
# the guarantee is kept rather than degraded.

    needs to know a tier is covered AT ALL, while the early margin needs to know HOW MANY copies the
    pool already holds (`declare_early_items` counts the vanilla copies too -- they are protected
    pool items like any other).

    This IS visible at this layer, and it is exact rather than a guess. Every somber stone matches
    `filler_curation._ECONOMY_SUBSTR` ("Smithing Stone"), so `_is_junk_consumable` -- and therefore
    `displaceable_filler` -- is False for all of them: core.create_items ranks them PROTECTED
    (rank 1), never lists them among the budget slots this module plans over, and never overwrites
    one. A tier the vanilla pool already covers is already in the seed, so it must not spend a
    reservation slot covering itself a second time.

    The walk is deliberately the SAME walk `budget_slots` does -- [HUB] + world._kept() over
    LOCATION_ITEM, DLC exclusion applied -- because a floor sized against a pool the world does not
    actually build is precisely the composed-pipeline bug this module exists to kill.

    The one way it can over-report: core trims `extras` down to the number of slots. That trim eats
    rank 3 (the Rune sentinel) then rank 2 (displaceable junk) first and only reaches a protected
    item on a seed with fewer locations than protected items -- a seed with no upgrade economy to

    The regular ladder's failure mode is DENSITY -- +3 costs six Smithing Stone [1] -- so the floor
    above it is a COUNT. The somber ladder's failure mode is a different thing entirely. A somber
    weapon costs exactly ONE stone per level and the tier IS the level, so a tier is never scarce or
    plentiful: it is present, or it is a WALL. No Somber [7] in the seed means every somber weapon
    stops at +6, permanently, however many [1]s are lying about.

    And absence is ROUTINE, because the draw is an i.i.d. weighted sample WITH REPLACEMENT: at
    num_regions=1 the reservation is ~19 draws over a taper that gives [9] a 1/9 share, so
    P(no [9] drawn) ~= 0.65 and P(no [3] drawn) ~= 0.04. A player reported exactly the [3] case
    ("zero Somber Smithing Stone [3] in the game") on 2026-08-02.

    Until that date `_draw_stones` RETURNED here, before the regular top-up, so NO somber tier had
    any guarantee at all -- the module's tier-1 guarantee was regular-only and the somber ladder was
    pure luck. It now gets the floor that matches the failure mode it actually has, paid exactly the
    way the regular one is: by converting the DEEPEST stones already drawn. It never grows the
    reservation, so `allocate`'s count is untouched and a seed cannot buy coverage it cannot afford.

    AND THE EARLY MARGIN (2026-08-04; boblerrr's playtest: the Somber [1]/[2] sphere-0 floors "may
    not be getting restricted" on small num_regions seeds). `early_guarantee` promises
    EARLY_GUARANTEE_MARGIN copies of Somber [1..EARLY_TARGET_LEVEL] reachable from the start, but
    `declare_early_items` is an AP placement HINT -- it can only declare what the pool already
    holds, and it clamps and warns on a shortfall. A ONE-copy presence floor therefore left the
    TWO-copy early promise a coin flip: at num_regions=1 the reservation is ~20 draws, the pool
    held a single copy of a low tier in ~10-20% of seeds per tier (measured over 54 full
    generations, 2026-08-04), and fill then delivered exactly the one copy it was declared --
    sphere 0 tracked the pool seed for seed, so the RESTRICTION was never the broken half, the
    SUPPLY was. A guarantee that clamps to supply is a hope. Supply is created here, where the

    test_every_juice_name_is_useful_from_the_table asserts the TABLE is why. If a future flip
    demotes a juice category, that test reds -- which is the signal to argue about the category, not
    to reinstate this.
