"""scadu_supply -- guarantee the Scadutree blessing has the fragments its CAP was budgeted for.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The blessing ships an injection budget (`SCADU_INJECTION_TARGET`, 12 -- it lived in
`scaling.SCADU_BLESSING_CAP` until 2026-08-06, where it also served as a ceiling that no longer
exists) whose entire purpose is to bound an INJECTION -- SPEC-global-scadutree-blessing-20260729 §9.2 put it to Alaric as
*"Injection budget. SCADU_CUM[20] = 50 fragments is a lot of filler to displace in a base seed. Cap
at 12 (26 fragments) instead?"*, and its acceptance criteria read:

    Pure (world): injection count is a function of the cap; a no-DLC seed at mode 1 contains
    >= SCADU_CUM[cap] fragments; a DLC seed injects none.

**The cap shipped. The injection did not.** Until this file, the only occurrence of `SCADU_CUM`
anywhere in `greenfield/` was inside the comment at `scaling.py:387` explaining the cap. So the
ceiling sat over a supply that arrived purely by luck of the DLC-region draw.

MEASURED (2026-08-01, 40 seeds per row, `num_regions_order: rolled`, `enable_dlc: 1`): reaching the
cap needs 26 fragments, and at the SHIPPED DEFAULT of `num_regions: 6` only **1 seed in 40** could
get there. Median reachable blessing was 3 of 12. Seed `AP_90729554631839684613` -- 8 regions, one
of them DLC (Enir Ilim) -- carried **3** fragments, i.e. blessing level 2 against a cap of 12.

THE TRIGGER IS A COUNT, NOT A BOOLEAN
-------------------------------------
The spec's own rule ("a DLC seed injects none") is a boolean standing in for a count, and building
it as written would NOT have fixed the reported seed: that seed *is* a DLC seed and is 23 fragments
short. One DLC region satisfies the boolean while missing the target entirely -- the same wrong-arity
shape CONTRIBUTING's "when the data contradicts the model, the MODEL changes" section is about.

So the rule here is arithmetic on the number:

    inject = max(0, SCADU_CUM[cap] - natural)

from which no-DLC (inject 26), one-DLC-region (inject 23) and full-DLC (inject 0) all fall out.
"A DLC seed injects none" becomes a *consequence* rather than a condition.

COUNT-NEUTRALITY
----------------
Modelled on features/presence_floor.py, which is modelled on features/progressive.py. `create_items`
returns pool items; `core.create_items` adds every feature's contribution BEFORE it sizes the filler
tail (`slots = total - len(pool)`), so each injected fragment displaces exactly one filler/Rune tail
slot and the pool stays count-exact. Nothing here adds a location.

Injected copies are `useful`, never progression: fragments gate nothing, and promoting them would
over-constrain fill for no logical gain. `filler_curation.COLLECTATHON_ITEMS` already protects
"Scadutree Fragment" from junk seizure, so natural copies survive as themselves and are not
displaced by the tail -- which is what makes `natural` a number worth subtracting.

DLC OFF
-------
"Scadutree Fragment" is a DLC good, so with `enable_dlc` off it sits in `world.gf_dlc_excluded` and
injecting it would leak DLC content into a base-game pool (the class `test_gf_dlc_pool_leak` guards).
This feature therefore injects NOTHING when the fragment is excluded, and says so.

That leaves mode 1 + `enable_dlc: 0` structurally inert -- the blessing is on and there are no
fragments to raise it. The spec's phrase "a no-DLC seed" is ambiguous between "DLC content disabled"
and "DLC content enabled but no DLC region kept"; this file implements the second and refuses the
first, because the leak guard is the stronger constraint and a silent leak is worse than a stated
no-op. Flagged for a ruling rather than silently picked.

# The injection may never claim more than this share of a seed's locations.
#
# ⭐ IT BINDS NOW, BY DESIGN (2026-08-06). When this landed it could not fire on a real seed -- the
# smallest measured seed was 727 locations, because `goal: auto` force-kept GOAL_REGION and its
# REGION_PARENT closure put a 3-region floor under `num_regions: 1`. SPEC-ashen-capital-lock
# removed that force-keep (the burn is an item now), so a genuinely one-region seed exists for the
# first time: hub + one region, 240-360 locations. On 16 of the 30 possible draws (measured
# 2026-08-06, tests/test_gf_scadu_supply.py sweeps all of them) 50 units will not fit in a 10%
# share; injection stops short of SCADU_INJECTION_TARGET, `create_items` WARNS with the numbers,
# and the blessing tops out around level 14-18 instead of 20. That degrade is the RULING, not a
# bug: the target is a difficulty knob (`useful`, gates nothing, no player-facing promise names
# it), while the clamp is what keeps a tiny seed's pool from becoming a fragment pile -- the whole
# reason it exists. The clamp wins; the loss is stated; CLAMP_FLOOR_LEVEL below bounds it.
MAX_POOL_SHARE = 0.10

# The blessing level the clamp must never starve a REAL seed below: the ORIGINAL shipped cap

# When 12 WAS the target it was judged an acceptable whole-playthrough supply, so it is the line
# between "tops out early" (fine, warned) and "starved" (a defect).
#
# 2026-08-25 (#1013): NOW ENFORCED IN CODE, as a bounded breach of the share ceiling. It was
# deliberately NOT enforced ("a floor that overrides the share ceiling would breach it exactly on
# the degenerate pools the ceiling exists for") while real geometry kept the floor unreachable --
# the smallest one-region draw still injected 32 units. Enia's shop going vanilla removed her 100
# hub rows, and with them the smallest draw (Abyssal, hub + one tiny region, ~150 locations) fell
# through the floor: 2 natural + 20 clamped injected = 22 < 26 units. The ruling on the
# clamp-vs-floor trade the old comment asked for: the floor wins, but ONLY the floor -- the
# breach is capped at SCADU_CUM[CLAMP_FLOOR_LEVEL] units (never the target), so a ~150-location
# seed pays ~18 items (~12%) for level 12, not 36 items (~24%) for level 20. The target stays

# reasoned about survives, because that reasoning was always about POOL PRESSURE and never about
# where to stop:
#
#   SCADU_CUM[20] = 50 fragments vs SCADU_CUM[12] = 26, for +11% attack. In a base-game seed every
#   one of those 24 extra fragments is a forced-`useful` item displacing filler.
#
# So this is what the seed GUARANTEES is reachable, not what it permits. A lucky region draw can
# still carry a player past level 12; nothing clamps them.
SCADU_INJECTION_TARGET = 20

# ⭐ WHY 20 AND NOT A CHOSEN NUMBER (2026-08-06). Datamined from gen_inputs.db, ItemLotParam_map +
# ItemLotParam_enemy, goods 2010000: vanilla hand-places 46 fragment lot slots -- 42 of them x1 and
# 4 of them x2 -- for exactly **50 units**, which is exactly SCADU_CUM[20]. FromSoft budgeted the
# base game to reach the top of the ladder on a complete sweep. So the target is not a balance pick
# at all; it is the game's own supply, restated. (The 12 that used to live here was a POOL-PRESSURE
# argument, and the stack below is what answers that instead.)

# Share of injected UNITS delivered as x2 stacks, as a divisor: one x2 per this many units.
#
# 4 => half the units arrive stacked (each x2 is 2 units). 50 units becomes 12 x2 + 26 x1 = 38 pool
# items instead of 50 -- so raising the target from 12 to 20 costs ~12 more item slots, not 24.
#
# 🛑 NOT VANILLA'S OWN RATIO, DELIBERATELY. Vanilla's mix is 4 stacks in 46 drops; mirroring it
# would need ~46 items for the same 50 units and would buy nothing, and calling that "authentic"
# would borrow authority the number does not have -- where FromSoft hand-placed a x2 is a fact about
# level design, not a rule about pool budgets. Alaric's call 2026-08-06: a visible MIX, weighted for
# the pool, rather than either extreme (all-x1 is 50 items; all-x2 is 25 and no mix at all).
