"""The apworld <-> client slot_data CONTRACT -- single source of truth (matt-free greenfield).

Every key that flows from the apworld's fill_slot_data into the runtime client is declared here ONCE:
its exact name, its wire SHAPE (tied to the client's parser), whether it is required, which contract
PROFILE(s) use it (greenfield / bedrock / both), which apworld module PRODUCES it, which client
file:fn CONSUMES it, and a one-line semantic. `validate_slot_data()` checks an assembled slot_data
dict against these declarations so a shape/spelling/required drift fails at GEN time (this is what
would have caught the list-vs-scalar `locationFlags` bug). `to_markdown/json/rust` emit the docs and
the language-neutral + Rust-side mirrors so the client validates the SAME contract (two-sided).

STRICT EMISSION (F2 fix, 2026-07-06): validate_slot_data now also REJECTS any emitted key that is
not declared here (top-level and inside the `options` sub-dict). registry.merge_slot_data gates
feature contributions through BY_NAME too, so an undeclared key fails at the merge, not in-game.

NESTED KEYS / OPTIONS ECHO (F1 fix, 2026-07-06): the client's option parsers read
`slot_data["options"][<key>]` (er-logic/src/options.rs parse_bool_option), but features used to emit
their toggles TOP-LEVEL only -- so death_link/enable_dlc/no_weapon_requirements/scaling knobs were
silently dark while "slot_data OK". The `options` ContractKey below declares the sub-dict; each
sub-key is its own ContractKey carried in `subkeys=`. core._options_echo emits it centrally; the
features' top-level emissions remain as harmless legacy duplicates (declared below as such).

`required` is PROFILE-AWARE: it only applies when validating a profile the key belongs to. Keys
tagged (BEDROCK,) are therefore never required (nor shape-checked) for a greenfield gen, and
vice versa.

To add a key: add ONE ContractKey below. To swap to Bedrock compatibility: emit the keys tagged
`bedrock` and validate with profile="bedrock"; the two contracts are diffable in this one file.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SHARED DERIVED-DATA (single source of truth so the apworld and client CAN'T drift). The PROGRESSION
# SURFACE = the LOCATION_TAGS classes this world's own progression may occupy. ONE definition, both
# sides. (`BIG_TICKET_TYPES` / `is_big_ticket` are RETIRED -- test_gf_progression_surface_contract
# asserts the contract no longer carries them. The name is gone too: it is what let a SECOND selection
# masquerade as a second mechanism.) ONE definition, both sides:
# features/curated_fill.py routes region Locks onto these, and the client's F6 tracker highlights /
# filters them -- via slot_data `progressionSurfaceLocations`, emitted from THIS set. So "where the
# locks go" == "what the tracker flags" by construction, and it is now true PER SEED rather than per
# corpus. (Until 2026-07-28 the client half came from tools/gen_location_regions.py baking an
# on_surface column into er_logic::tracker_regions -- both the tool and that table are retired; the
# tracker's region model ships in slot_data.) The DEFINITION lives here in the contract.
# The location-CLASS vocabulary. Consumed by features/progression_surface (valid_keys + the widen
# ladder) and coverage.py.
# 🛑 THIS ORDER IS A DETERMINISM HANDLE, NOT A DISPLAY ORDER. `selected_surface()` filters a
# player's set THROUGH this list precisely because a Python set of strings has no stable iteration
# order across processes, so reordering it would change the ladder -- and the fill behind it --
# between two runs of the same seed. It reads as historical accretion because it IS: append here,
# never rearrange. The wizard's grid is grouped by FAMILY instead, from a separate presentation
# order in features/progression_surface.SURFACE_CLASS_FAMILIES.
# (There is no `big_ticket_locations` option; the surface is selected by ProgressionSurface.)
# "EniaShop" is INTERNAL (gen_data tags the remembrance store) and is never user-selectable.
# RENAMED 2026-08-08: was `IMPORTANT_LOCATION_TYPES`, a name that outlived its option
# (features/important_locations was deleted 2026-08-02). This list is purely the PROGRESSION
# SURFACE vocabulary now -- features/progression_surface.valid_keys + the widen ladder, coverage.py
# -- and it is not in contract.json, so the rename cost no client churn.
# 🛑 The rename had one real hazard, and it was not the call sites that FAIL loudly: two readers
# used `getattr(contract, "IMPORTANT_LOCATION_TYPES", ())` WITH A DEFAULT. coverage.py would have
# silently classified every location as filler, and test_gf_boss_sweeps'
# test_field_exclude_matches_contract would have compared FIELD_EXCLUDE against an EMPTY set and
# passed VACUOUSLY -- a green parity gate over nothing. Both are direct attribute access now: if
# this constant is ever renamed again, they must break.
# "LegacyBoss" ABSORBED into MajorBoss 2026-08-20 (Alaric): a boss standing in a legacy dungeon
# is a major by any player's reading, and the split earned nothing but a wizard row. The yaml
# spelling stays ACCEPTED -- ProgressionSurface.from_any normalizes it to MajorBoss (the
# limgrave_caves alias precedent) -- so no wild yaml breaks; only the vocabulary shrank.
# 🛑 The TAG "LegacyBoss" is still baked (SURFACE_INTERNAL_TAGS): the MajorBoss tag doubles as
# roster identity for goal/anchor/roster consumers, so the absorption is done at has_class via
# SURFACE_CLASS_EXTRA_TAGS rather than by retagging the data.
# The lockable abilities (#945). The AUTHORITATIVE name list is er-logic's Ability enum
# (crates/er-logic/src/ability_lock.rs parse_set); this mirror exists so the OptionSet's valid_keys
# and the wizard can enumerate them without importing Rust. Order matches the enum. `heal` is NOT
# here -- its mechanism is the flask-charge clamp, not an action lock. Keep the two in sync: a name

# SUBSET of Remembrance/GreatRune"; measured over LOCATION_TAGS the relation is the REVERSE, and it
# matters for what the wizard can tell a player:
#   Remembrance (25) and GreatRune (7) are SUBSETS of MajorBoss (52)  <- not the other way round
#   MajorBoss is itself a SUBSET of Boss (266), as are LegacyBoss (52) and FieldBoss (110)
#   MajorBoss n Legendary = 2; neither contains the other
# Counts re-measured over LOCATION_TAGS 2026-08-16, and MajorBoss moved TWICE that day for two
# unrelated reasons, which is worth keeping straight:
#   52 -> 43  (#737 direction 1) a roster entry is keyed on a boss's acquisition FLAG, and the
#             sibling lots that flag also drives -- two DLC bosses' entire ARMOUR SETS -- were
#             inheriting the tag. One check per boss.
#   43 -> 51  (#737 direction 2) the roster stopped being a hand list and became the game's own
#             achievement table: +11 achievement bosses that had no MajorBoss check, -3 hand anchors
#             whose regions the roster now covers.
# `Boss` did not move on either (266). Margit is an achievement boss with NO check anywhere in our
# data and is ledgered as such in gen_data._ACH_NO_CHECK rather than counted here.
# So ticking MajorBoss in the default surface already covers every Remembrance and GreatRune check:
# those two boxes select NOTHING further, and ticking Boss makes all three redundant. The lattice is
# DERIVED at wizard-build time (features/progression_surface.class_containment) rather than typed
# here, because a typed copy is what let this comment sit inverted. It is its own tag so the surface
# can target JUST the majors.
# BIG-TICKET IS RETIRED (2026-07-12, Alaric). It was a SECOND list claiming to define "the important
# checks", and it disagreed with the first: the progression surface is
# {Remembrance, Seedtree, Church, Boss, Fragment, Revered}, while big-ticket targeted {MajorBoss,
# Remembrance, GreatRune}. Their intersection was Remembrance ALONE -- so the client's tracker starred
# MajorBoss/GreatRune checks that progression_surface FORBIDS progression from ever reaching. The
# tracker pointed the player at checks the locks could not be on, by construction, and nothing noticed
# because the two lists had no contract with each other. It surfaced only when a human read a spoiler
# and asked why killing Malenia paid out a Smithing Stone [4].
#
# ONE definition now: the surface. The client is fed it directly (progressionSurfaceLocations), so
# "where the locks may be" and "what the tracker stars" are the same expression, not two lists that
# happen to agree. (Same disease as the three-pass filler tail -- see features/filler_budget.)
#
# EXCLUDE tags survive: a location carrying one is never on the surface. EniaShop = Enia's remembrance
# store (a shop slot holding a rarity-3 item) -- buy-only, so no region Lock and no tracker star even
# when Shop or Legendary is selected.
SURFACE_EXCLUDE_TAGS = frozenset({"EniaShop"})

# INTERNAL tags: present in LOCATION_TAGS, deliberately NOT in SURFACE_CLASSES (not user-selectable)
# and NOT excluding. "LegacyBoss" survives as a tag because goal_locations / anchor eligibility /
# the roster-uniqueness law read the raw MajorBoss tag as ROSTER identity; only the CLASS was
# absorbed (2026-08-20, Alaric). Matched onto the MajorBoss selection via SURFACE_CLASS_EXTRA_TAGS.
SURFACE_INTERNAL_TAGS = frozenset({"LegacyBoss"})

# CLASS -> extra internal tags that selection also matches. THE absorption seam: has_class and
# features/progression_surface.class_containment both read it, so the surface and the wizard's
# covered-by lattice cannot disagree about what a class covers.
SURFACE_CLASS_EXTRA_TAGS = {"MajorBoss": frozenset({"LegacyBoss"})}

# The DEFAULT progression surface. It lives HERE, beside has_class, because it has two consumers that
# cannot import each other:
#   * features/progression_surface.ProgressionSurface.default -- the AP option (needs the AP env)
#   * [RETIRED 2026-07-28] tools/gen_location_regions.py      -- baked the tracker's static column;
#     the surface now reaches the client as slot_data progressionSurfaceLocations instead
# Retiring `is_big_ticket` (20bc529) renamed the predicate but left the SELECTION inlined in the option
# class, where the AP-free generator could not reach it. So the generator kept calling the old name and
# the Windows build died at the tracker-table step. Single-sourcing a predicate is only half the job:
# the SELECTION it is applied to must be single-source too, or the second caller re-invents it.
# 🛑 `Remembrance` AND `GreatRune` LEFT THIS SET 2026-08-16 (#733) AND THE SURFACE DID NOT MOVE.
# Both are STRICT SUBSETS of `MajorBoss`, measured over the generated LOCATION_TAGS:
#
#     Remembrance 25 | GreatRune 7 | MajorBoss 43
#     Remembrance ⊂ MajorBoss   GreatRune ⊂ MajorBoss   Remembrance ∩ GreatRune = 0
#     allowed_ap_ids(defaults) == allowed_ap_ids(defaults - {Remembrance, GreatRune})  -- 199 == 199
#
# So while `MajorBoss` is in this set the two entries admit not one location, and the wizard drew them
# as two live knobs a player could reason about. They are not MERGEABLE either (disjoint: a demigod
# arena yields two separate checks, the Remembrance by method tag and the Great Rune by item name), so
# the redundancy is real and the tidy-up is not.
#
# 🛑 THEY STAY IN `SURFACE_CLASSES` AND IN `valid_keys`. `OptionSet` raises on an unknown key, so
# dropping them would make every existing yaml that names one fail outright, and `Options.Removed` is
# per-OPTION, not per-KEY -- there is no migration. A player who selects them still gets exactly what
# they ask for; they are simply no longer ON by default, because on-by-default implied they did
# something. Pinned by test_gf_progression_surface_contract, which asserts the identity above rather
# than the membership, so re-adding them is caught by MEANING and not by a name list.

    # WHY. The surface is ~30 locations on a 4-region seed against ~1500 checks, and
    # `confine_foreign_progression` (default 100) may place another world's progression ONLY there.
    # Measured: a slot received 7 of the 60 foreign key items it would have received at confine 0 --
    # the other 53 stayed in their own world and the checks were backfilled with our own items. One
    # member per enabled sweep roughly TRIPLES the surface and takes intake to 18 (DOOM), 44 (Hollow
    # Knight), 28 (Bumper Stickers), while `confine`'s promise stays exactly kept (nothing foreign
    # lands off-surface). It also relieves the small-surface case: at num_regions 1 with a
    # [MajorBoss] surface the feasibility ladder was spilling our OWN Locks off a two-location
    # surface, and this takes that spill to zero.
    #
    # WHAT IT COSTS. A sweep can now pay out progression in a default seed -- kill the boss, and one
    # of the checks it hands over may hold a key. That was already true at `confine 0` or an empty
    # surface (63% of foreign progression landed on sweep members, exactly the base rate), and it is
    # not a logic hazard: a member's access rule is its REGION, so the sweep only makes the check
    # earlier, never reachable-only-that-way. It IS a texture change, and it is the ruling.

    filter.

    Three sources, and the split is the point:

    * DERIVED -- a trigger `BOSS_HEALTHBARS` cannot name (absent, or a blank name field). This is
      the honest gate: it does not claim the dungeon has no boss, only that we cannot vouch for one,
      which is the same standard ShopSlot holds a merchant to.
    * DECLARED -- `runtime_sweep_skips()`, for triggers that ARE named and still cannot fire.
      Patches is the confirmed case and cannot be derived; see that dict's comment.
    * AUDIT -- when `arena_regions` is supplied, every trigger absent from that authoritative table.
      The sweep may still pay ordinary members, but it cannot make one of them REQUIRED until the
      arena is audited (#671). `triggers` narrows this to the actual sweep universe; when omitted,
      the healthbar keys are the best available trigger corpus.

    `healthbars` is injectable so the gate is testable without the data module, and so
    tools/build_region_census.py can price the wizard's SweepSlot checkbox off the same expression
    the seed uses -- the single-source rule `nominate_sweep_slots` already documents.

    # The problem this solves

    In a 2-game world the partner holds ~269 progression items and has nowhere to put them but its
    own ~404 locations, so they saturate during `fill_restrictive` and the useful tier is exhausted
    before the scan reaches a partner slot. Our surface is player-agnostic already

    not permission -- it is HOW MANY SLOTS EXIST. In an 8-game world that pressure is spread and
    one-per-sweep is right.

    🛑 PURE, AND DELIBERATELY NOT RANDOM. `nominate_sweep_slots`'s own docstring forbids drawing
    here: `world.random` is consumed a different number of times depending on how hard fill works, so
    a draw would move the seed for everything downstream -- and the census must reproduce the
    selection outside a generation at all. This is arithmetic on a count, nothing else.

    🛑 SOLO IS ONE. A lone player has nowhere to send anything, so widening the surface buys nothing
    and would change a solo seed for no reason. `n_foreign_players <= 0` is that case, and it also
    keeps the expression away from a division by zero.

    this.

    `slots` comes from [`slots_per_sweep`] at the world call site (#703). The census cannot know the
    partner count -- it prices the checkbox BEFORE a multiworld exists -- so it asks for both ends

    number of times depending on how hard fill works, so drawing here would move the seed for
