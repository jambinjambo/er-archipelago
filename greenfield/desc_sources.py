"""desc_sources.py -- build a human LOCATION DESCRIPTION for every check.

WHY: the in-client tracker (docs/history/SPEC-item-tracker.md) renders each check by its AP
location NAME. gen_data mints that name as ``{region} :: {item} [f{flag}]``. When a region holds
several checks of the SAME vanilla item -- e.g. four ``Scadutree Fragment`` -- the only thing that
separates them is the opaque ``[f<flag>]`` id, so a player staring at four identical rows has no idea
which one to go get. Alaric, 2026-07-17: "the locations need to have descriptions."

WHAT: a single description string, appended by gen_data so the tracker row reads
``{region} :: {item} -- {desc} [f{flag}]`` (the flag is KEPT as a stable, unique tiebreaker; the
description is the human-readable part). ``describe()`` returns that ``desc`` (no flag, no item),
or ``None`` when even the last-resort locale is unknown (then the name stays bare).

PURE + DATA-INJECTED: every source is passed in as a plain dict so this module imports and unit-tests
in the sandbox with NO elden_ring_artifacts and NO Archipelago (see eldenring/tests/test_gf_location_desc.py).
gen_data.py loads the real sources (committed tsvs + the datamined boss tables) and calls describe().

PRIORITY WATERFALL (first non-empty hit wins):
  1. override      location_descriptions.tsv  (flag -> English)     -- hand-authored, always wins
  2. boss          boss/remembrance drop       -> boss/enemy name    -- clean English, from boss tables
  3. spot          treasure_name_en.tsv        (flag -> English)     -- CURATED place phrase (opt-in)
  3b. merchant     merchant_shops.tsv          (flag -> seller names) -- WHO sells it (shop rows)
  4. grace         nearest_grace.tsv           (flag -> grace name)  -- coord datamine (Windows regen)
  5. locale        method + map sub-tile                              -- always available, last resort

Layers 3 and 4 are the two that need extra data: layer 3 is a small curated file (most raw
``treasure_name`` values are asset-id noise -- ``award`` / ``c0000_9000`` / ``アイテム光000`` -- not places),
layer 4 needs per-flag coordinates that only exist after a Windows datamine (tools/datamine_item_grace_coords.py
-> tools/build_nearest_grace.py). Until either file exists, gen_data still gives every check a layer-5
locale, so nothing is ever bare.

def sweep_clause(boss_name, tile=None):
    """The ", may be sweep-granted by X" tail a sweep MEMBER's description carries, or None.

    Appended to whatever the waterfall resolved rather than being another layer of it: the sweep is
    an ADDITIONAL route to the check, not a better description of where it sits. `describe()` is
    first-hit-wins, so a sweep layer would have had to either lose to the grace layer (invisible) or
    beat it, and throw away the location the player actually walks to.

    # WHY THIS EXISTS (er-archipelago#670)

    bobler, 2026-08-14, hinted `Mt. Gelmir :: Perfume Bottle - near Craftsman's Shack [f66740]` for
    his Altus Lock: *"also how can my lock be a perfume bottle? is that a boss fight location"* ...
    *"so idk what boss to kill?"* Under SweepSlot the answer is that a boss hands it over, and the
    name -- which is all an AP hint has to work with -- never said so.

    # 🛑 ELIGIBILITY, NEVER A GRANT -- AND NEVER "KILL"

    The member is an ordinary pickup and stays a valid route, and 106 of 218 sweep triggers have no
    audited region (#671), so we cannot promise the boss is reachable this seed. This states a fact
    about the world; an imperative would be a promise we cannot keep.

    The clause said "also granted by X" through v0.5.1 and was reworded for v0.5.2 (#936). WHY: a
    location name rides the STATIC AP datapackage, which is minted once for the corpus and cannot
    see a seed. What a seed actually pays is `enabled_sweeps(world)` -- the `dungeon_sweep` rung plus
    the progression-surface cut -- so "granted by" was a promise the corpus is not entitled to make.
    colombius, Discord 2026-08-27, on a Seedtree the surface cut had taken back out of the Fire Giant
    sweep: *"not granted by the Fire Giant sweep"*; Haraldwyrm reported the same shape a week earlier.
    Alaric's ruling: *"when we are leaving them off sweeps, we shouldn't say they're granted by the
    sweep."* "MAY BE sweep-granted" is true in every seed, because ELIGIBILITY is the corpus fact
    and a grant is not; the clause now claims exactly what the datapackage knows, and no more. The
    client half is clients#460, which recognises both openers. Readers that DO hold the seed (the client
    tracker, via slot_data `dungeonSweepFlags`) still narrow it to a definite grant -- #670's answer
    to bobler's "so idk what boss to kill?" survives where the truth is available, and stops being
    asserted where it is not.

    🛑 SHAPE, NOT JUST WORDING. The reword keeps the clause's one shape -- a ", "-opened tail whose
    only parenthesis is the tile, sitting last before the " [f<flag>]" tail -- because every reader
    strips it back off by that shape. Wordings that fold the boss and tile into one parenthesis
    (`" (Fire Giant sweep-eligible, m60_52_52)"`, sketched in #936) NEST when the boss name itself
    carries parens -- `Night's Cavalry (Glaive)` -- and a paren-blind splitter cuts them wrong.

    # 🛑 THE TILE IS NOT DECORATION

    Trigger names are NOT unique -- `Night's Cavalry` names EIGHT different sweeps, `Death Rite Bird`
    five, `Erdtree Burial Watchdog` / `Black Knife Assassin` / `Deathbird` / `Bell Bearing Hunter` /
    `Tree Sentinel` four each. "May be sweep-granted by Night's Cavalry" sends the player to any of eight
    encounters, so `tile` disambiguates when given.
