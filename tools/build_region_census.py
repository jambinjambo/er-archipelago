"""build_region_census.py -- the per-region numbers the options wizard shows you WHILE you choose.

WHAT THIS IS. One artifact, `wizard/region-census.json`, holding the two things a player needs to
size a seed before generating it, split by region so the wizard can recompute them live as
`num_regions`, `enable_dlc`, `dlc_only` and `progression_surface` move:

  * how many CHECKS each region contributes, and
  * how many of those checks may actually HOST progression, per progression-surface class.

WHY. Two players asked the same question from opposite ends in two days: bobler asked why
`num_regions: 1` kept four regions, and a Nexus commenter asked what fraction of "2000 checks for 6
areas" is filler before committing his friends to a multiworld. Both answers exist only after you
generate. #409 already added the gen-log line that explains the kept set -- but a log line is read
AFTER the decision it would have informed. This puts the number in front of the choice.

AND THE NUMBER IS A RANGE, WHICH IS THE POINT. `num_regions` is a DRAW SIZE, not a final count
(region_spine.compute_kept: draw + explicit-goal force-keeps + parent closure). At the default 6 the
real check count ranges about 1069..2279 depending purely on WHICH regions the draw takes. A wizard
that printed one number would be lying; the census gives the wizard what it needs to show the spread,
which teaches the draw-size model in one glance.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not estimate the filler/useful split. That one genuinely needs a built
world (features/filler_budget + the pool builder reshape the tail), so it belongs in a sampled table,
not here. Deliberately out of scope rather than approximated.

CLASS COMBINATIONS, NOT PER-CLASS COUNTS -- read this before "simplifying" the schema.
Surface classes OVERLAP: one check is routinely `GreatRune` + `MajorBoss` + `Boss` at once. So a
{class: count} table cannot be summed over a player's selection without over-counting exactly the
checks that carry two selected classes. `regions[R]["combos"]` is therefore keyed by the SORTED TUPLE
of vocabulary classes a check carries (joined with "|"), and a consumer computes the surface as

    sum(count for combo, count in combos.items() if selected & set(combo.split("|")))

which is an exact union for any selection. There are 27 distinct combinations, so this costs a few KB
and removes a whole class of wrong answer.

BARS ARE NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE. `tools/build_surface_confidence.py` already prices every class
against the six bars that stop a check hosting progression (guessed_region, missable, erdtree_burn,
surface_excluded, release_gated, hub_merchant) and its `ProgressionSurface` docstring says outright:
quote that file, never a number in prose. This tool IMPORTS that one by path and reuses `_load()` and
`_bars()`, adding only the region axis -- so there is exactly one definition of "can host" in the repo.
`test_gf_region_census` pins the union of this table over the default classes to that tool's own
`default_hosting` total, so the two cannot drift apart silently.

THE CHECK-COUNT IDENTITY the wizard evaluates:

    checks = hub + sum(kept regions) + finale

where `finale` is the Ashen Capital's checks and exists iff a base-game region is in play
(features/finale.finale_active -- the Ashen Capital is NEVER rollable, is not in REGIONS, and is not
counted by num_regions; it hangs off the hub behind its own Lock). Verified against real built worlds
at num_regions 0/3/4/6, enable_dlc off, and dlc_only on: zero delta, including dlc_only correctly
dropping the finale.

AP-FREE by construction, like the tool it borrows from: the generated modules are loaded BY PATH,
because importing the `eldenring` package pulls `BaseClasses`. That keeps it runnable in the coverage
half of CI, which has no Archipelago.

    python tools/build_region_census.py            # write the JSON and inject it into wizard.html
    python tools/build_region_census.py --check    # exit 1 if either copy is stale (CI drift gate)
