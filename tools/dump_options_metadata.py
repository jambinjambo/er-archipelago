"""
dump_options_metadata.py -- extract the ER apworld's full option surface to JSON.

The yaml options wizard (wizard/wizard.html) renders ENTIRELY from this JSON, and the
standalone presets/*.yaml are emitted from the same run, so this tool is the single source
of truth for "what options exist and what they do".

WHY THIS IMPORTS THE WORLD (it used to ast-parse a static options.py)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As of v0.2 the option surface is DYNAMIC: `GFOptions` is built at import time with
`make_dataclass(registry.collect_option_fields(...) minus FROZEN_OPTIONS)` (core.py). There
is no static `options.py` with an `EROptions` dataclass to parse -- the yaml-settable surface
only exists once the world is imported and the freeze is applied. So we install the world
into a pinned upstream Archipelago (via tools/gf_test.py, the one installer) and introspect
the REAL `GFOptions` dataclass. Zero drift: the wizard describes exactly the options the world
generates from.

Emitted per option: yaml key (canonical dataclass order), class name, kind
(choice/toggle/range/set/list/dict/text), display_name, docstring, default, choice values,
range bounds, valid_keys.

Usage (needs the pinned AP env; --ap-dir defaults to .ap-test/, bootstrapped on demand):
    python tools/dump_options_metadata.py              # write ALL THREE artifacts
    python tools/dump_options_metadata.py --check      # exit 1 if any artifact is stale (CI drift gate)
    python tools/dump_options_metadata.py --ap-dir DIR # reuse an existing upstream AP checkout

🛑 THE PLAIN RUN EMITS ALL THREE ARTIFACTS, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. There are three copies of
this surface -- wizard/options-metadata.json, the same blob inlined in wizard/wizard.html, and
presets/*.yaml -- and until 2026-07-29 the inject and preset writes were opt-in flags. So the
obvious command wrote ONE of the three and silently left the other two behind: four regen commits
on 2026-07-28/29 moved the JSON without re-injecting, and the wizard page lost `dungeon_sweep`,
`pool_builder_intensity` and `region_grace_unlock` outright. A tool whose default leaves the tree
half-applied will half-apply it (CONTRIBUTING rule 9). `--presets` and `--inject` are still
ACCEPTED so old muscle memory and old docs keep working -- they are now no-ops.

Round-trip guarantee: every field appears in the JSON with a non-empty description
(enforced here AND by worlds/eldenring/tests/test_options_descriptions.py).
