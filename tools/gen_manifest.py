"""gen_manifest.py -- the ONE definition of the greenfield gen-input content hash.

Both `greenfield/gen_data.py` (which stamps the hash into every generated module) and the build
gate (`build.ps1` / `gen-greenfield.ps1`, via `python -m tools.gen_manifest`) call THIS file, so the
hash means the same thing on Linux and on Windows. See SPEC-gen-input-hash-gate-20260710.md.

The hash covers everything a regen depends on: the tracked inputs (region_map.csv, item_tiers.tsv,
optional region_overrides.tsv), the licensing-restricted datamined artifacts (grace tables, the EMEVD
event dir, the item-name FMG xml, the two ShopLineupParam csvs), the datamine INTERMEDIATES
(boss_drops.py / boss_healthbars.py -- so a stale datamine step is caught), and gen_data.py ITSELF
(the transform is part of the input; a code change with unchanged data must invalidate the stamp).

Determinism across OSes:
  * relpaths are forward-slash, sorted.
  * text inputs are newline-normalized (CRLF/CR -> LF) before hashing, so a Windows autocrlf checkout
    and a Linux LF checkout of the same logical file hash identically.
  * a declared-but-absent input hashes as the literal "ABSENT" (well-defined either way) and is also
    reported in `missing`, so a caller can refuse to *verify* when artifacts aren't present rather
    than trust a hash computed over a partial input set.

CLI:
  python -m tools.gen_manifest                 # print "sha256:...."  (stdout, for PS to capture)
  python -m tools.gen_manifest --json          # full manifest as JSON
