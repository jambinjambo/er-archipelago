"""datamine_unplaced_globals.py -- give the UNPLACED common-event rows a tile, where the data can.

THE DEFECT (issue #249, reported in game: Thops still drops the vanilla Academy Glintstone Staff).
`region_map.csv` files a row as `Global / Common-event (unplaced)` when nothing decoded a tile for
its flag. gen_data then emits no location for it, `check_lots` never blanks the vanilla lot, and the
player gets the vanilla item. Nothing errors: the item simply is not a check.

This tool is the DERIVATION half. It does not invent placements. A narrow retained-evidence ledger
below preserves map-specific talk-award answers that an older complete corpus proved when a newer
extract contains only the common-bucket copy; those rows remain named, reviewable evidence rather
than silently disappearing with an incomplete extract.

EVIDENCE, in precedence order (strongest first):
  1. `msb_flag_region.tsv` / `check_maps.tsv` -- an OBSERVED map for the flag.
  2. `item_grace_coords.tsv` -- an item entity observed at an exact map-local coordinate. This is
     the missing path for fixed world pickups whose short/common flag carries no tile itself.
  3. a map EMEVD initializer that carries BOTH the acquisition flag and one of its item lots as
     arguments. The pair is the award site; a bare flag mention would only prove a reader/gate.
  4. the lot -> actual talk-ESD award join: `esd_gifts.tsv` identifies AwardItemLot calls, and the
     matching decompiled talk filename is bucketed by map
     (`elden_ring_artifacts/talk/<map>-only/`). Incidental flag/lot reads do not count.

🛑 IT REFUSES, LOUDLY, IN TWO CASES, and the refusals are the point:
  * MORE THAN ONE map. NPCs relocate, so the ESD names every site they award from -- Dancer's
    Castanets is named in m16_00, m31_00 and m60_00. Picking one would be a confident wrong answer
    of exactly the kind CONTRIBUTING rule 1 is about, and a wrong region is worse than none: it
    asserts a reachability we do not have (see DEFAULTED_REGION_APS).
  * NO evidence at all. The tool prints these and leaves them absent. The narrow hand-confirmed
    exceptions (including Thops's f400361 report from #249) live visibly in GLOBAL_RECOVER; they do
    not justify widening this derivation for unrelated rows.

    grounds that placing them "would DOUBLE-COUNT a single in-game pickup". That premise was false:
    of those 62, **61 sit on ItemLotParam rows DISTINCT from every name-twin and 0 share a lot**, so
    the rule was discarding real, separately-collectable checks whenever two sites happen to award
    the same common item (Golden Rune [1], Glowstone, Smithing Stone [1], Dragon Heart, ...).

    MOTIVATING CASE (rule 11): boblerrr, 2026-08-07, client 0.3.7. `Blessing of Marika` is awarded by
    lot 30950 (flag 530950, a real check) and lot 30935 (flag 530935, dropped by the name rule). He
    collected BOTH on one character -- `!flag` reads `true` for each -- and got a check from the
    first and the vanilla item from the second. One item name, two award rows, two pickups.

    A NAME match is not a SITE match. Two different lots are two different award events, so the only
    thing that proves "this is the same pickup" is sharing a lot. Where flag_lots.tsv knows no lot
