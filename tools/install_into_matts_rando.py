"""Wire the Archipelago client into matt's randomizer launcher -- without moving a single file.

WHAT THIS EDITS (measured on a live v0.11.4 install, 2026-08-21; spec on issue #944):

WHEN THE TOML DOES NOT EXIST YET it is CREATED, carrying only the one line this tool owns
(`modengine = { debug = false, external_dlls = [ ... ] }`, the app's own measured single-line
style). v0.4.11 acceptance, 2026-08-21: the original refusal instructed "open 'Add dll mod'
once, close it (the app writes the file)" -- Alaric followed it on a fresh install and NO file
appeared, so that instruction was an unverified assumption doing the work of a feature. If
matt's app dislikes a file it did not write, delete the toml and report it; nothing else is
touched.
matt's launcher persists its "Add dll mod" list in `config_eldenringrandomizer_dll.toml`
beside `EldenRingRandomizer.exe` -- a small machine-written TOML. The adjacent
`config_eldenringrandomizer.toml` is hash-guarded and AUTO-GENERATED ("DO NOT MODIFY");
the app regenerates it and merges the dll list at launch. This script therefore writes ONLY
the `_dll.toml`, and performs exactly one mutation: ensure its `external_dlls` array names
OUR `eldenring_archipelago.dll` -- by absolute path, IN PLACE inside the release's `me3/`
folder, where its two data tables live beside it.

Replace-by-basename IS the upgrade path: re-running after a release repoints a stale
versioned-folder path in one command (the frozen-pointer failure this exists to kill --
a launcher was measured loading a v0.3.12 client months into v0.4.10 because the remembered
path still said v0.3.12).

WHAT THIS REFUSES, loudly (exit 1):
  * the bundle is incomplete (dll or either data table missing -- a dll without
    `check_lots_table.json` / `shoplineup_flags.json` beside it double-pays vanilla items
    and never fires shop checks, so that failure belongs at install time);
  * the target folder has no `EldenRingRandomizer.exe`;
  * `EldenRingRandomizer.exe` is running (the app holds the dll list in memory and can
    rewrite the file over our edit);
  * `config_eldenringrandomizer_dll.toml` exists NEARBY but not in the target folder
    (--randomizer points at the wrong level; the refusal names where it was found).

OPTIONAL TORRENT REPAIR (`--with-torrent-repair`): adds Elden Ring 1.17's four missing Spectral
Steed RideParam rows and their four matching NpcParam rows to Matt's regulation.bin. It backs up
regulation.bin, preserves every existing binder entry and existing row byte-for-byte, verifies the
encrypted candidate, and replaces the target atomically. Soulstruct is required only for this mode.

Exit codes: 0 = changed, 2 = already current (idempotent no-op), 1 = refused.
All output is ASCII. Timestamped backups are written before either owned file changes.
