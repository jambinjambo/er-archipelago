"""check_wizard_census_js.py -- differential gate: the wizard's JS seed-size math vs Python's.

The number a player actually reads is computed in JavaScript, inside `wizard/wizard.html`'s
`wizard-core` block (`ERW.seedSize`). Every other gate in this repo proves things about the census
DATA; none of them execute that function, so a JS-side mistake would ship silently behind four green
Python gates.

WHAT IT DOES. Extracts the `wizard-core` script and the injected census blob from wizard.html, runs
`ERW.seedSize` under node for a fixed matrix of option sets, and compares each result against an
independent Python evaluation of the SAME rule in this file. Two implementations, one expectation --
a real differential test, not a restatement: the Python side here is the reference, and the Python
side is itself pinned to REAL BUILT WORLDS by
`worlds/eldenring/tests/test_gf_region_census.py::test_check_count_identity_against_real_worlds`.
So the chain is JS == Python == a world Archipelago actually generated.

DETERMINISM is what makes this comparable at all: `ERW.seedSize` draws from a seeded mulberry32 with
a fixed seed, so a given option set has ONE answer. The Python side re-implements mulberry32 and the
same draw order rather than sampling independently -- comparing two Monte Carlo runs would only ever
prove they agree to within noise, which is not a gate.

NEEDS NODE. Exits 4 (SKIP) when node is absent, so a box without it reports honestly instead of
passing vacuously. `greenfield/ci-linux.sh` and `run_ci.ps1` treat exit 4 as SKIP; CI runners have
node, so the gate is live there.
