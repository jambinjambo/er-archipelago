"""regen_all.py -- THE regen entrypoint. ONE step list, every consumer reads it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (issue #699, 2026-08-15). The regen procedure was written down in three
places and they disagreed:

  * `AGENTS.md` section 5a -- the one humans and agents are TOLD to follow. It stopped at the
    generated `.py` modules and named NONE of the page builders.
  * `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` (`generators` job) -- the complete emitted set, plus
    `gen_area_tiers.py --check`.
  * `build.ps1 -Greenfield` -- the complete emitted set MINUS `gen_area_tiers.py --check`.

MOTIVATING CASE (CONTRIBUTING rule 11). PR #698, 2026-08-15: an agent followed the AGENTS.md
recipe exactly, committed, and `generators` went red with

    apworld generated output is STALE -- regenerate and commit:
     er-archipelago-questline-dag.html | 2 +-

one line -- the page's `inputs_hash` stamp. The three root pages EMBED the stamp, so ANY change
that moves `inputs_hash` (including a comment edit to `gen_data.py`, which is `FILE_INPUTS[0]`)
re-stales all of them. That makes it every data PR's problem, not one agent's mistake, and only
CI's byte-diff notices. `tools/build_questline_dag_page.py` appeared nowhere in AGENTS.md or
CONTRIBUTING.md at all.

So the list lives HERE, once, and the consumers invoke this file instead of enumerating it.
`greenfield/eldenring/tests/test_gf_regen_all.py` is the gate that keeps it honest: it fails if a
stamp-bearing committed artifact, or an output declared by a staleness-checking `tools/build_*.py`,
is not reachable from `STEPS`. The latter is producer-driven -- generated files do not become
invisible merely because they live below `greenfield/` or `wizard/` instead of at the repo root.

WHY A NEW `tools/` SCRIPT AND NOT `gen_data.py --all`. `greenfield/gen_data.py` is
`gen_manifest.FILE_INPUTS[0]` -- its BYTES are hashed into `inputs_hash`. Adding a driver flag to
it would re-stamp every generated module and all three pages on a change that generates nothing,
which is the exact defect class this file exists to stop. A standalone `tools/*.py` with argparse
and a WHY docstring is also the shape the rest of `tools/` already has.

THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING -- THE STAMP IS WRITTEN, THEN READ.
`gen_data.py` writes `_GEN_STAMP`; the three pages EMBED it. Build a page before the stamp and it
carries the PREVIOUS one and the CI diff gate is red. `STEPS` is in execution order and the phases
run in `PHASES` order; do not reorder either without reading this paragraph.

PHASES (`--phases`, default all, in this order):

  inputs   materialise gen_data's inputs from the committed bundle (idempotent)
  modules  the datamines -> gen_data.py -> the generated `eldenring/*.py` modules + `_GEN_STAMP`
  tables   the CROSS-REPO tables + repo-side contract and confidence tables
  pages    stamp-embedding readers plus generated wizard payloads

CLIENT-DEPENDENT STEPS ARE GATED HERE, IN ONE PLACE -- and that gate had to be written, because
MEASURED 2026-08-15 in a submodule-less checkout the three client steps fail three DIFFERENT ways:
`gen_contract.py` prints "skip contract_gen.rs (client src dir absent)" and exits 0;
`gen_area_tiers.py --check` prints a reason and exits **4**; `gen_region_locks.py` dies with a bare
`FileNotFoundError` traceback. Rather than "fix" three scripts a Windows build depends on, this
file asks the question once (`crates/` present?) and SKIPS the group loudly. In CI and on the box
the client IS checked out, so nothing is skipped there.

Run:
  python3 tools/regen_all.py                        # everything (the AGENTS.md section 5a recipe)
  python3 tools/regen_all.py --phases tables,pages  # what build.ps1 / the `generators` job need
  python3 tools/regen_all.py --list                 # print the steps, run nothing
