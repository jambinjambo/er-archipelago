"""check_wizard_keymeta_js.py -- differential gate: the wizard's key_meta rendering contract.

`progression_surface` ships PER-KEY presentation into the wizard (`key_meta`: a label and hint for
every class, a family to draw it under, and the subset lattice). Two things about that can be wrong
in ways every existing gate is blind to:

1. THE GRID CAN SILENTLY LOSE A CLASS. The renderer draws keys by walking `key_meta.families` and
   then the keys claimed by each family -- so a class that no family claims, or a family with no
   keys, is simply not drawn. The player then cannot select something the world offers, and the page
   looks complete. `surface_class_meta()` raises on that gap in Python; this gate proves the SHIPPED
   metadata (which is what the page actually reads) has no such gap, and that every drawn key is a
   real `valid_keys` member -- a label for a key AP would reject is a trap, not a hint.

2. THE REDUNDANCY HINT CAN INVERT. `ERW.surfaceCoverage` inverts the containment relation to tell a
   player "you already have these". Get the direction wrong and it confidently says the opposite --
   which is exactly the failure that already happened once, in prose: contract.py carried this
   lattice as a comment and the comment was BACKWARDS for months (it called MajorBoss a subset of
   Remembrance/GreatRune; it is their superset). A comment cannot be executed. This can.

3. THE NUMBER ON THE BOX CAN DRIFT FROM THE NUMBER THE FILL OBEYS. The grid shows what each class
   contributes to the surface (`ERW.surfaceMarginals`), computed in JS from the region census. That
   is the figure a player chooses on. This gate closes the loop on it three ways: JS == an
   independent Python evaluation; single-class totals == the `eligible` column of
   greenfield/surface_confidence.tsv; and the default selection's total == that file's headline
   hosting number. surface_confidence is itself pinned to `features/progression_surface
   .allowed_ap_ids` by test_gf_surface_confidence, so the chain is
   **wizard JS == Python == surface_confidence == allowed_ap_ids**, i.e. the number a player reads is
   the number the fill obeys. Nothing else in the repo executes that JS.

   NOT COVERED HERE, on purpose: whether the census's per-region `dlc` flags are right. The
   cross-check runs DLC-on, so corrupting those flags does not move it -- verified by mutation.
   `test_gf_region_census.test_check_count_identity_against_real_worlds` builds REAL worlds with
   `enable_dlc: False` and `dlc_only: True` among its cases, which pins them harder than anything
   this file could assert about a json blob. Duplicating it here would only add a second thing to
   keep in step.

WHY A DIFFERENTIAL, not an assertion: the Python side below re-derives coverage from `contains`
independently, and the expectation for the load-bearing case is pinned to the LIVE tag data rather
than typed -- `MajorBoss` really does contain `Remembrance`, and the gate asserts the pair from the
shipped lattice, so it cannot be satisfied by two implementations agreeing on a wrong table.

NEEDS NODE. Exits 4 (SKIP) when node is absent, mirroring check_wizard_census_js.py, so a box
without it reports honestly rather than passing vacuously.
