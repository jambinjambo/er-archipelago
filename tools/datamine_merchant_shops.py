"""datamine_merchant_shops.py -- which PHYSICAL merchant opens each ShopLineupParam row, and where.

WHY
---
tools/datamine_shop_rows.py assigns a shop check's region by "a block is ONE MERCHANT" (its docstring
lines 40-47) -- inheriting the region of the already-classified rows in the same shopBlock (rowId//100).
That premise is FALSE for the nomadic-merchant range. Block 1007 holds TWO merchants: a Liurnia nomadic
merchant (rows 100700-100720) AND the Hermit Merchant's Shack in Altus (rows 100725+). The whole block
was tagged Liurnia, so the Hermit's ~30 checks were region-scoped to Liurnia and SEALED OUT of any roll
that drops Liurnia -- even though the player reaches him in kept Altus (Alaric, in-game 2026-07-23:
vanilla item, no check fired; the one hand-pinned sibling, Perfume Bottle flag 66750, fired as "Altus"
the same session). The mirror roll (keep Liurnia, seal Altus) is worse: those become reachable-Liurnia
checks whose merchant stands in sealed Altus -> unreachable progression (one carried a region Lock).

THE FIX: derive the merchant->row-range->map join from GROUND TRUTH instead of the block guess. A
merchant NPC's talk ESD opens a ShopLineupParam id RANGE (OpenRegularShop(begin, end)); the NPC is
placed in an MSB, which gives the physical map. So:

    talk ESD  ->  (begin, end) shop range        [this file, from script/talk]
    MSB Enemy <TalkID>  ->  map tile             [this file, reuses datamine_msb_item_regions machinery]
    ESD binder filename  ->  map tile (2nd hop)  [this file]
    map tile  ->  AP region                      [gen_data owns this -- we emit map ids, per house style]

Emits greenfield/merchant_shops.tsv, one line per (shop row, opening merchant instance):
    row_id \t talk_id \t npc_param_id \t merchant_name \t map_id \t map_source \t note
gen_data resolves map_id -> region (via _gt_region / DUNGEON_REGION_OVERRIDE) with precedence:
FLAG_REGION_OVERRIDE (hand pins) > ESD-derived merchant map > legacy block inheritance. A row opened by
merchants in >1 distinct region collapses to HUB + DEFAULTED (the shop_multi convention). A row no ESD
opens gets NO line (unknown -> stays DEFAULTED; never guessed).

ARTIFACTS (all under elden_ring_artifacts/, licensing-restricted, .gitignore'd; run on WINDOWS):
  * talk/<map>-talkesdbnd-dcx/t<talkid>.esd  (or t<talkid>.esd.xml)  -- NEW UNPACK, see below
  * mapstudio/<map>-msb-dcx/Part/Enemy/*.xml  (witchy MSBE export; already used by other tools)
  * vanilla_er/vanilla_er/ShopLineupParam.csv, NpcParam.csv  (Smithbox param dump)

PRODUCE THE ESD UNPACK (once, on Windows):
    copy  <ER install>\\Game\\script\\talk\\*.talkesdbnd.dcx  ->  elden_ring_artifacts\\talk\\
    WitchyBND.exe elden_ring_artifacts\\talk\\*.talkesdbnd.dcx      (same tool that made the -msb-dcx dumps)
  -> elden_ring_artifacts\\talk\\m*-talkesdbnd-dcx\\t*.esd[.xml]

ESD FORMAT (confirmed from a real dump, t351006000.esd, 2026-07-23): raw binary EzState ("fsSL"). A
command argument is an int-literal expression `0x82 <int32 LE> 0xA1`. `OpenRegularShop(begin, end)`
stores its two args as ADJACENT literal expressions: `82 <begin> a1 82 <end> a1`. So a shop range is
that exact 12-byte signature with BOTH ints in the ShopLineupParam band [SHOP_LO, SHOP_HI]. This is
precise, not a guess: in the sample it matched the ONE real command (100350,100399) and rejected the
~85 in-band integers sitting in the ESD's data tables (values stepping by 16/32, never wrapped in a
0x82..a1 literal) that the old consecutive-any-integer heuristic wrongly paired into a dozen phantom
ranges. If a future WitchyBND serializes ESD to XML/text instead, we fall back to a regex for the same
literal pattern. Run with --probe first to eyeball the extraction; anchors (Twin Maidens cover 101800,
the Altus Hermit block 1007 lands on an m60_4x tile) validate it before the tsv is trusted.

USAGE (Windows, artifacts present):
    python tools/datamine_merchant_shops.py --probe          # dump what it extracts on anchor ESDs
    python tools/datamine_merchant_shops.py                  # write greenfield/merchant_shops.tsv
    python tools/datamine_merchant_shops.py --maps m60_40_54 # subset (validation)

#
#   * nameId SPLITS one NPC across questline states. Alaric, 2026-07-26, in-game: "scribe corhyn and
#     brother corhyn same guy" -- 135100 and 135101 are one man, and keying on nameId reports him as
#     two merchants on 4 and 2 maps instead of one on 6. Generalising his correction finds a second:
#     Knight Bernahl / Recusant Bernahl.
#   * nameId also MERGES: every row whose nameId is 0 collapses into one phantom "merchant" standing
#     on 6 maps. (name_of() refuses nameId 0 for this reason.)
#   * npc_param_id SPLITS one NPC across instances: Gostoc has SIX (36650014..36650514), Sellen four,
#     Patches three.
#   * talk_id // 100000 looks like the answer and is not. MEASURED over this table: it reproduces
#     Alaric's Corhyn correction and finds Bernahl (good), but it MERGES the anonymous merchant
#     CLASSES -- 8011/8012 lump Nomadic/Isolated/Hermit/Imprisoned/Abandoned Merchant together, and
#     those are many physical people -- and it SPLITS Sellen across 3160/3162/3163.

# unresolved. If you need real identities, they have to come from a datum this table does not carry.
