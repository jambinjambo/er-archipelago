"""DERIVE every shop check from ShopLineupParam ground truth. No hand classification.

WHY
---
Shop checks were being taken from `region_map.csv`'s hand-classified `method` column, and that column
gets it wrong in a way that silently loses items.

The tell (Alaric, playtest 2026-07-11): the White Cipher Ring is not randomized in the Twin Maiden
Husks, but the Blue Cipher Ring is. Their rows are identical twins:

    row 101800  equipId=104 (White Cipher Ring)  equipType=3  sellQuantity=1  eventFlag_forStock=60280
    row 101801  equipId=105 (Blue Cipher Ring)   equipType=3  sellQuantity=1  eventFlag_forStock=60290

For a ONE-TIME shop item the stock flag IS the item's "obtained" common-event flag -- the same number
does both jobs. So 60280 got classified `method=global` ("Global / Common-event (unplaced)") instead of
`shop_merchant`, and `global` rows only survive if a map tile can be decoded out of the flag. A 5-digit
flag like 60280 decodes to nothing, so it was dropped: flag 60280 is not a location ANYWHERE. The row is
never rewritten, the shop sells the vanilla ring, and buying it fires nothing. A silently lost check.
Blue survived purely by luck of the classifier.

Sweeping the param instead of the hand column finds 110 such rows:
    76 "class A" -- no location anywhere; the item is simply LOST (White Cipher Ring among them)
    34 "class B" -- the flag IS a location via its world/NPC source, so the check still fires, but the
                   row is never rewritten -> the shop hands you the VANILLA item as well.

THE PREDICATE
-------------
A shop row is a detectable AP check iff

    eventFlag_forStock > 0   AND   sellQuantity >= 1

i.e. it has a flag, and the stock is LIMITED so that flag flips when you buy it. Unlimited rows
(sellQuantity == -1) are excluded on purpose: for those the flag is a stock UNLOCK (the bell-bearing
gate), not a purchase record -- watching it would fire the check when you hand in the bell bearing.
(Of the 1277 rows: 822 carry a flag, but 143 of those are unlimited. 635 distinct flags are sound.)

REGION
------
ShopLineupParam row ids are `shopBlock * 100 + slot`, and a block is ONE MERCHANT. Block 1018 holds the
White Cipher Ring, Blue Cipher Ring, Spirit Calling Bell, Flask of Wondrous Physick, Crafting Kit and
Memory Stone -- that is the Twin Maiden Husks inventory exactly. So a row inherits the region of the
already-classified rows in its own block. That is a structural fact about the param, not a guess.

Blocks with NO known region, or with more than one, are emitted region="" -- gen_data then treats them
as DEFAULTED (hub-quarantined, barred from carrying progression). Refusing to answer beats answering
confidently wrong.

NAMES
-----
FMG, via the witchy'd msg bundle. equipType selects the table:
    0 Weapon -> WeaponName, 1 Protector -> ProtectorName, 2 Accessory -> AccessoryName,
    3 Goods  -> GoodsName,  4 Gem      -> GemName
`equipId` is the RAW row id (no category nibble), so it indexes the FMG directly.
