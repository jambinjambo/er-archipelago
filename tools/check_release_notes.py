check_release_notes.py -- the release-notes gate (CONTRIBUTING rule 14).

Every player-visible change lands its CHANGELOG line in the SAME commit, and the
blurb for the open version is drafted as the window fills. This gate is the thing
that checks it, because a bullet list nobody checks is a to-do list (rule 13).

MOTIVATING CASE (rule 11): v0.3.0 shipped 2026-08-01. By 2026-08-02 main carried five
more player-visible fixes -- two of them straight off Nexus bug reports -- with no
v0.3.1 changelog section and no blurb, and no BLURB-v0.3.0.md either: the blurb series
had stopped dead at v0.2.18 and nothing said so. Rebuilding the notes took a walk of
`v0.3.0..main` plus four commit bodies, and the "why it mattered" in those bodies is
not the "why it mattered" a player needs.

Deliberately AP-FREE and import-FREE: APWORLD_VERSION is parsed out of
greenfield/eldenring/contract.py textually, so this runs in the cheap CI job, in the
Linux sandbox, and on a box with no Archipelago checkout.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_release_notes.py           # gate the current APWORLD_VERSION
    python3 tools/check_release_notes.py --check   # identical (alias; see below)
    python3 tools/check_release_notes.py --version 0.3.1   # gate some other version
    python3 tools/check_release_notes.py --git-range v0.4.2..v0.4.3  # audit a historical window

`--check` is a no-op alias. Every neighbouring repo-level gate is invoked as
`tools/<x>.py --check` (dump_options_metadata, gen_region_locks, build_questline_dag),
where it means "verify, do not write". This tool never writes, so the flag is
redundant -- but a CI step that passes it should not die on argparse.

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = >=1 ERROR, 2 = bad invocation / cannot find what it must read.

    MOTIVATING CASE, and it is this repo, not a hypothetical: v0.3.3 was tagged on 2026-08-03 while
