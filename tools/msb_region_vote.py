r"""msb_region_vote.py -- an OFFLINE, in-repo second opinion on a check's region.

WHY. `tools/audit_region_second_opinion.py` asks two public wikis where a check's vanilla item
is found. That join key is the ITEM NAME, so it is silent on the 209 generic-name rows and thin
everywhere else. This module asks a completely different question of data we already own: the
check's own MSB coordinates. It folds the pickup into the single overworld frame and votes the
region of the NEAREST region-attributed Site of Grace.

WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT. This is a RANKING SIGNAL, not an adjudicator.

  * It measures 91.4% over 2607 CONTROL checks -- the ones whose region is NOT
    `(region unconfirmed)` and that carry MSB coords (`--calibrate` re-derives it). One row in ten
    is wrong, by construction: a grace is not a region boundary, and the nearest one across a
    cliff, a lake or a tunnel mouth belongs to somewhere you cannot walk to. The largest error
    families are the ones you would predict -- Scadu Altus/Shadow Keep (52), Leyndell/Ashen
    Capital (29), Liurnia/Mountaintops (23) -- regions that share a border or a coordinate frame.
  * It is the SAME KIND of derivation as the nearest-neighbour tile hop that produced the 305
    unconfirmed regions in the first place -- a hop that CANNOT FAIL (CONTRIBUTING rule 1).
    An agreement between two nearest-neighbour hops is therefore NOT independent corroboration.
    What it is good for is ORDERING the hand-adjudication: a vote that disagrees with us AND
    with the wiki is worth a human's next hour; a short-distance unanimous vote that backs us is
    worth the least.
  * The decisive instrument is the point-in-volume PlayArea test, which reads the exact runtime
    `PlayRegionID` instead of guessing from a neighbour. It needs the extracted MSB corpus, which
    CI does not have. `docs/PLAYAREA-ITEM-SCAN.md` is the runbook for running it; when it has
    run, its answers REPLACE these votes (`vote_note` becomes `PLAYAREA-CONFIRMED`).

INPUTS (all committed; nothing is fetched, nothing needs game files):
  greenfield/item_grace_coords.tsv        map-local XYZ for items and graces
  tools/overworld_fold.py                 THE tile fold (LOD-aware) -- never re-implement it
  greenfield/grace_region_map.tsv         grace -> warp-menu play_region
  greenfield/grace_ground.tsv             grace -> the play_region BUCKET of the ground it is on
  greenfield/eldenring/region_play_ids.py REGION_PLAY_IDS: play ids -> our region vocabulary

THE ANCHOR CLASS THAT LIES (`SUSPECT-ANCHOR`). A grace's region is read from the warp menu
first; where the warp menu names a play_region we do not own, we fall back to the BUCKET of the
ground it stands on. When that ground row's own source is `tile-default` -- i.e. no PlayArea
volume contained the grace and we took the tile's default bucket -- the grace's region is itself
a tile-wide guess, and every vote it anchors inherits that guess. 22 graces are in that class.
Grace 73211 "Yelough Anix Tunnel" is the one that matters here: it anchors 17 votes that flip
Mountaintops rows to Consecrated Snowfield, and its own region came from a tile-default row on
tile m60_47_55. Those rows are BADGED, not dropped -- a badge is a reader's warning; dropping
them would hide a cluster that may well be right.

`CROSS-TILE-MSB` is the other note that changes how a row reads: the audit's `map_tile` comes
from the check label, but the MSB row that actually holds the coordinates can live on a
DIFFERENT fine-grid tile (three Bestial Sanctum checks are labelled m60_51_41 and their coords
are authored in m60_51_43). Where those disagree the label's tile is the weaker of the two, and
the vote is the one computed from the MSB. `COARSE-LOD` marks a coords row authored on a LOD1/2
tile: the fold handles it (pitch = 256 << lod, plus the centring term), but the position is
coarser and a reader should know before trusting a 300 m margin.
