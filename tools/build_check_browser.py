"""build_check_browser.py -- render the whole check corpus as ONE offline HTML page.

Writes er-archipelago-check-browser.html: a single self-contained file (no server, no CDN,
no game artifacts) that lets you search, facet and inspect every check the world defines.
Meant as a datamine READING tool -- it is a pure join over already-committed generator
output, so it can never disagree with gen_data unless one of its inputs is stale.

AP-FREE and import-free: the generated .py modules are read with ast.literal_eval, never
imported, so this runs with a bare python3 and no Archipelago on sys.path.

INPUTS (all committed; none are game files):
  greenfield/eldenring/data.py              LOCATIONS: region -> [(name, ap_id, flag)]
  greenfield/eldenring/location_tags.py     LOCATION_TAGS + DEFAULTED/BURN ap-id sets
  greenfield/eldenring/missable_locations.py MISSABLE_LOCATIONS: ap_id -> reason
  greenfield/check_maps.tsv                 flag -> physical map tile(s)
  greenfield/nearest_grace.tsv              flag -> nearest Site of Grace
  greenfield/lot_gates.tsv                  flag -> gate flag(s)
  greenfield/flag_lots.tsv                  flag -> ItemLotParam rows
  greenfield/map_names.tsv                  map tile -> dungeon name
  greenfield/location_descriptions.tsv      hand-authored descriptions
  greenfield/shop_rows.tsv                  ShopLineupParam row detail
  greenfield/treasure_enablers.tsv          StartDisabled enabler verdicts
  greenfield/msb_gated_treasures.tsv        StartDisabled=1 MSB records
  greenfield/esd_gifts.tsv                  NPC dialogue gift gate paths
  greenfield/esd_gates.tsv                  merchant shop-range gate paths
  greenfield/synthetic_flag_recovery.tsv    phantom-flag verdicts (negative space)

GATE EVIDENCE IS PLURAL. lot_gates.tsv covers 110 checks and is the SMALLEST of four
corpora that document gating; showing it alone taught the reader "110/4879 are gated",
which is the partial-read this project keeps getting burned by. All four are joined, each
counted separately, and each rendered beside its own tsv header VERBATIM -- because those
headers carry the polarity rules (EndIf has INVERTED sense; self_set_flags is a MEMO, not a
prerequisite; NO_ENTITY_HANDLE is PROOF OF NO GATING, not mystery) and a UI that flattened
them to "gated: yes/no" would invert their meaning.

NEGATIVE SPACE. The page also carries the join RESIDUALS -- rows in those side tables that
are NOT checks -- with the recorded reason where one exists and an honest blank where none
does. That population is where every wrong claim here has come from.

DETERMINISM: the output is a pure function of those inputs -- every set is emitted sorted and
the page is stamped with data.py's _GEN_STAMP.inputs_hash, NOT with the git commit. This is
what lets CI regenerate and fail on a non-empty diff (see .github/workflows/tests.yaml
`generators`); embedding a commit hash would make the committed file stale by construction.
