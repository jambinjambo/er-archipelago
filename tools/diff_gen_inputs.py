"""Diff two `gen_inputs.db` bundles — what a game patch actually changed in the params.

WHY
---
`gen_inputs.db` is a SNAPSHOT of the vanilla regulation (239 param CSVs, zlib blobs). When
FromSoftware patches the game we re-dump it from Smithbox and recompile the bundle — and then we
need to know what moved, because several of our features are pinned to facts about the OLD dump
that nothing re-checks on its own:

  * We REPURPOSE vanilla `SpEffectParam` rows at runtime (`no_equip_load` 20012080,
    `no_fall_damage` 20010827, `scadu_blessing` 20012081, `traps::no_flask` 20012082 -- the live
    registry is `er-logic/src/safe_speffect_rows.rs::CLAIMED`). Each was claimed on the strength of
    "occurs exactly once across all 239 param tables — as its own row". A patch that adds a
    reference to one of those rows makes us silently rewrite something the game reads, and the
    symptom is a BALANCE bug in one area weeks later, not a crash.
  * We index off ladders whose base id we read at runtime (`baseScaduBlessingSpEffectId`
    20000100..20000120, the DLC enemy-scaling ladder 20007000+10i). A patch that extends or
    re-points those changes what our arithmetic means.

`tools/verify_safe_speffect_row.py` answers "is this ONE row still safe" precisely. This answers
the broader "what changed, and did anything move into territory we depend on".

USAGE
-----
    # the OLD bundle comes out of git; the NEW one is the freshly recompiled file
    git show <rev>:gen_inputs.db > /tmp/old_gen_inputs.db
    python tools/diff_gen_inputs.py /tmp/old_gen_inputs.db gen_inputs.db

    python tools/diff_gen_inputs.py old.db new.db --only SpEffectParam --only EquipParamProtector
    python tools/diff_gen_inputs.py old.db new.db --watch-only     # skip the row diff, just the
                                                                   # id-range guard (fast)

Exit code 1 if anything landed in a WATCHED id range — i.e. "a human must look at this before
shipping". Row additions elsewhere are informational and exit 0. Read-only.
