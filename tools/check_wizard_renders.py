"""check_wizard_renders.py -- every step of the wizard must actually DRAW something.

WHAT ROTTED, TWICE, IN THE SAME WEEK. Both defects were a page that renders and says nothing:

  * 2026-08-08 (95c628a): the "What are you putting into the multiworld?" card read `item_shuffle`,
    an option frozen off the yaml surface three weeks earlier, so `!!undefined` sent it down its
    "nothing to send" branch on every render. Caught by check_wizard_lint_currency's page audit.
  * 2026-08-08 (9566a4d): `renderSeedSizeTab()` called `paintSeedSize()` before its own tree was
    attached to the document. `paintSeedSize` finds `#ss-head`/`#ss-rest` with
    `document.querySelector`, got null, and returned. THE WHOLE SEED SIZE STEP WAS BLANK on
    arrival -- no size figures, no composition bars, no contribution card -- until the player
    touched a control, because every `refresh()` lives in an event handler and `renderStep` calls
    none. Reported by a human looking at the page, which is the instrument this file replaces.

Neither threw. A DOM lookup that misses returns null, and an empty div renders fine. Every gate we
had reads the page as TEXT -- the metadata is current, the blob is in sync, the lint rules name
live options, the JS maths matches Python -- and not one of them renders it.

So this one runs it: the real `wizard.html`, under `tools/wizard_dom_shim.js`, walking every step
via the step rail's own click handlers, asserting each step draws a non-trivial amount of text and
that the cards we care about are on the steps that own them.

🛑 THE SHIM'S ONE LOAD-BEARING BEHAVIOUR is that `querySelector` resolves a node only when its
parent chain reaches the static HTML. Drop that and this gate goes green on the very bug it was
written for. There is a self-test below that asserts exactly this, so the shim cannot be quietly
loosened.

NEEDS NODE. Exits 4 (SKIP) when node is absent, so a box without it reports honestly. CI has node.

Usage:
    python tools/check_wizard_renders.py           # exit 1 if any step draws nothing
    python tools/check_wizard_renders.py --dump    # print what each step rendered

# after i messed with it enough". Both were the same thing seen twice: `filler_foreign_pct` and
# `keep_local_rune_cap` moved a FOOTNOTE and left every figure untouched, so a player working the
# knobs that matter watched a card that never answered. Nothing threw; a fuzz over 1,969 single-
# option states and 700 random multi-option states across every step found no exception at all.
#
# A card that renders is not a card that WORKS, which is the next question after check_renders'.
# The side rail's ORDER is a stated requirement, not a default. The live readout sits directly under
# the yaml because it is what you watch while you turn a knob, and "Generate & host" is last because
# it is the one card you touch once, at the end (Alaric, 2026-08-12). Card order is the kind of thing
# a later edit reshuffles without noticing, and nothing else in the tree records the reason.
