r"""gen_check_lots_table.py -- the VANILLA-SUPPRESSION table, for ANY apworld.

THE PROBLEM (measured in-game, 2026-07-13, first Bedrock playtest):

    vanilla suppressor INERT: checkItemFlags empty/absent in slot_data

Our client blanks a check's vanilla ware AT THE SOURCE -- it rewrites the check's own
ItemLotParam row so the game never hands the item over. But it learns WHICH lots to blank from
`checkLotBlankMap` / `checkLotBlankEnemy` in slot_data, and only OUR apworld emits those. Drive a
foreign apworld (Bedrock's) and the tables are empty: every check pays out the VANILLA item AND the
AP item. Playable, wrong.

THE INSIGHT -- and it is the same one that made shoplineup_flags.json work:

    the blank-list is derived from ItemLotParam: flag -> lot -> which slots hold a GOODS ware.
    That is GAME data. It is not seed data. It is identical for every seed and every apworld.

So SHIP IT STATIC. The client already knows the seed's check FLAGS (from `locationFlags`, or derived
from Bedrock's matt slot keys by key_resolver). Intersect those flags with this table and you have
the blank-list -- for ANY apworld, with zero changes on its side.

Emits greenfield/eldenring/check_lots_table.json:

    {"placeholder_goods": 8852,
     "map":   {"<flag>": {"lot": <lot>, "slots": [1..8]}, ...},   # GOODS slots -> blank at the lot
     "enemy": {"<flag>": {"lot": <lot>, "slots": [1..8]}, ...},
     "map_v2":   {"<flag>": [{"lot": <lot>, "slots": [1..8]}, ...], ...},   # SHARED-flag overlay
     "enemy_v2": {"<flag>": [{"lot": <lot>, "slots": [1..8]}, ...], ...},
     "items": {"<flag>": [<ER item id>, ...]}}                     # WEAPON/ARMOR wares -> suppress by id

THE SHARED-FLAG SHAPE (SPEC-flag-lot-item-model). One getItemFlagId can drive SEVERAL lots (Messmer
510460 -> lots 10460 + 10461, Remembrance + Kindling). The legacy "map"/"enemy" shape is one lot per
flag, and this generator used to fill it LAST-WRITE-WINS -- whichever sibling the CSV listed last
silently won, and the other lots were invisible to the static (foreign-apworld) path while gen_data's
per-seed path blanked them all. Two paths, two behaviours, both accidental. Now:

  * "map"/"enemy" (LEGACY, one entry per flag) stay for the shipped static_lots.rs parser, but the
    entry is DETERMINISTIC: the LOWEST lot id (the lot the region_map scan named the check after),
    never scan-order luck.
  * "map_v2"/"enemy_v2" (the OVERLAY) carry the COMPLETE per-lot list -- emitted ONLY for flags with
    more than one goods-carrying lot in that table, sorted by lot id. A consumer resolves a flag's
    blank-list as:
        entries(flag) = map_v2[flag]  if present  else  [map[flag]]
    (identical semantics for the ~4.2k single-lot flags, complete for the shared ones). The client
    static_lots.rs change to read the overlay is a SEPARATE follow-up (cargo); until it lands,
    foreign apworlds keep legacy one-lot blanking -- deterministic now, no worse than before. The
    gen-side coverage gate (coverage._load_static_table) reads the overlay already.

TWO MECHANISMS, because the game gives us two problems:

  * GOODS wares are blanked AT THE LOT (`map`/`enemy`): point the check's goods slot at the
    placeholder row, and the game hands over nothing. Suppressing goods BY ID would be a disaster --
    Golden Rune [1] backs 46 checks, so every Golden Rune you ever picked up would be eaten.
  * WEAPON / ARMOR wares are suppressed BY ITEM ID (`items` -> the client's `checkItemFlags`). That
    is sound for them and only for them: a weapon is essentially never farmable, so it lives in the
    check-only set and cannot eat a legitimate source.

Both halves derive from the same ItemLotParam rows, so both ship here. Without the `items` half a
foreign seed still double-dips on every weapon/armor check (517 of Bedrock's 3022, measured).

NOT filtered to our check flags. The whole point is that a foreign apworld's flag set is different
from ours -- filtering to `_CHECK_FLAGS_ALL` (which gen_data does, correctly, for our own seeds)
would silently drop exactly the rows a foreign world needs.

# `lotItemId` in ItemLotParam is the RAW id; the client's detour reads the AddItemFunc-space FullID
# (`category nibble | raw`), which is also ITEM_CATALOG's space. This table used to emit the RAW id.
# Weapons have nibble 0x0, so raw == FullID and they suppressed fine -- which is exactly why the bug
# hid: suppression *worked*, on a quarter of the items. Protectors, talismans and Ashes of War never
# matched, and every one handed out the vanilla item alongside the AP item.
#
# The first fix HARDCODED lotItemCategory -> nibble from a source comment that claimed to be "derived
# empirically" while containing no derivation. It was wrong (it had GEM at 0x5; the catalog says 0x8),
# and being wrong in a constant is precisely the class of bug this file keeps producing. So: derive it
# from the two tables we already have, and refuse to run if the mapping is not clean.



def name_witnesses():
