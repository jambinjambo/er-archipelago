#!/usr/bin/env bash
# deploy_wizard.sh -- put the right wizard at /er/ and /er/beta/ on the host box.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS CLOSES. The wizard is a static page and was deployed by copying it whenever
# somebody copied it, while the apworld ships on a tag. On 2026-08-08 the live page offered 44
# options and the newest tag had 42, and an option the installed apworld has never heard of does not
# fail -- Archipelago prints one line among ~50 loader errors and generates the seed WITHOUT it.
# See SPEC-publishing-pipeline.md.
#
# So: two channels, both built from a REF rather than from whatever was lying around.
#
#     /er/wizard.html        <- wizard/wizard.html at the STABLE tag (release/CHANNELS.tsv)
#     /er/beta/wizard.html   <- wizard/wizard.html at main
#     /er/checks.html        <- er-archipelago-check-browser.html at the STABLE tag
#     /er/beta/checks.html   <- er-archipelago-check-browser.html at main
#     /er/report.html        <- wizard/report.html at the STABLE tag
#     /er/questlines.html    <- er-archipelago-questline-dag.html at the STABLE tag
#     /er/beta/questlines.html <- er-archipelago-questline-dag.html at main
#     /er/landing.html       <- wizard/landing.html at the STABLE tag       (--landing only)
#     /er/tabs.js            <- wizard/tabs.js at the STABLE tag
#
# !! THE LANDING PAGE GOES IN ER_STATIC_DIR, NOT AT THE FILESYSTEM ROOT, AND THAT WAS A BUG.
# It first shipped writing ${ER_ROOT_DIR}/index.html on the assumption that peliarch served `/`
# from a static directory. It does not: `/` is a Flask route (webgui/app.py), and Caddy does
# `reverse_proxy web:8080` for everything -- so that file would have been written and never
# served, and nobody would have found out until the front page failed to change.
#
# The app now serves ER_STATIC_DIR/landing.html at `/` (peliarch PR #11), which is the same
# directory and the same atomic, tag-pinned install that wizard.html and checks.html already
# use. One directory, three pages, one deploy.
#
#   ER_STATIC_DIR=/srv/er ./tools/deploy_wizard.sh --landing
#
# ---- --site : ship a page fix WITHOUT cutting a release ----------------------------------------
#
#   ./tools/deploy_wizard.sh --site        # landing.html + report.html, from MAIN, in seconds
#
# THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. A typo on the landing page needed a tag, a CHANNELS promotion and a full
# deploy, because every artifact here is pinned to the STABLE tag. That is right for the wizard and
# wrong for a page that describes nothing.
#
# !! IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT "all the static pages". The wizard MUST NOT get ahead of the released
# apworld: Archipelago does not error on an option the installed apworld has never heard of, it
# prints one line among fifty and generates the seed WITHOUT it (SPEC-publishing-pipeline.md 2.1).
# The check browser and the questline DAG are joins over committed generator output, so a newer
# copy describes a corpus the released build does not have. All three stay on stable, always.
#
# THE SPLIT IS DERIVED, NOT A LIST SOMEONE MAINTAINS. A page is COUPLED if it carries an option
# surface (`er-options-metadata`) or a data stamp (`inputs_hash`); it is FREE if it carries
# neither. test_gf_publish_channels asserts SITE_PAGES below is EXACTLY the free set, in BOTH
# directions -- so a page that gains a stamp stops being shippable this way on the commit that
# gives it one, and a new page with no stamp cannot be silently left out.
#
# !! --landing FAILS UNTIL v0.4.0 IS TAGGED, and that is correct. It fetches from the STABLE tag,
# and wizard/landing.html does not exist at v0.3.10. The failure is loud ("fetch failed: landing
# stable (v0.3.10)") rather than a page silently not appearing. Promote stable first.
#
# THE CHECK BROWSER AND THE QUESTLINE DAG ARE PINNED THE SAME WAY AND FOR THE SAME REASON. Both are
# pure joins over committed generator output, so a copy from a different ref than the wizard beside
# it describes a different corpus -- the exact skew SPEC-publishing-pipeline.md measured on the
# wizard, one file over. Together they are ~3.2 MB, so `--no-checks` exists for a cron that runs
# oftener than the data moves; it skips both.
#
# !! THE QUESTLINE DAG IS HERE BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY EVER ON THE BOX BY ACCIDENT. Until 2026-08-13 the
# host served it because the Dockerfile's `ertools` stage BAKED it into the image at build time --
# so it existed, unpinned to any tag, and would have vanished the moment /er-static became a bind
# mount fed by this script. It was found by listing the container's directory before mounting over
# it, not by anything that would have told us afterwards. A file that only exists because of a build
# step nobody remembers is one rebuild from gone.
#
# It FETCHES, it does not build: the box needs no checkout, no python, no node. Nothing here is
# specific to peliarch except the default target, so it also works for any other host.
#
#   ER_STATIC_DIR=/srv/er ./tools/deploy_wizard.sh

#   ./tools/deploy_wizard.sh --beta-only            # baked stable: update only the mounted beta/

# Cron it if you like -- `beta` tracks main, so on a daily-stable project this wants to run at least
# as often as you merge:
#   */15 * * * *  ER_STATIC_DIR=/srv/er /opt/er/deploy_wizard.sh >>/var/log/er-deploy.log 2>&1
#
# !! THE INSTALL IS ATOMIC (write .tmp, then `mv`). A wizard is one 2 MB file that a browser can be
# mid-GET on; `curl -o` straight onto the served path serves a truncated page for the length of the
# download, and a half-parsed wizard renders as a blank div rather than an error anybody reports.

The page works out which it is from its own URL and banners itself, so nothing here edits the HTML.

Note the trailing slash: `/er/` maps to wizard.html, but `/er/beta/` does NOT -- the Flask route is
`/er/<path:filename>` and "beta/" is not a file. Link the full path, or add a route for it.
