"""build_questline_dag.py -- TIER 1 of SPEC-questline-dag-20260728: emit the graph, assert nothing.

WHAT THIS IS. One table, `greenfield/questline_dag.tsv`, of directed edges between EVENT FLAGS:

    source_flag  --(sense)-->  target_flag

`target_flag` is always a LIVE AP CHECK. `source_flag` is a flag the game tests before that check's
award can happen. `sense` says which STATE of the source the award needs -- and the two senses are
different animals, which is the whole reason this table exists rather than a list of "gates":

    sense=set    the source must be SET      -> a PREREQUISITE. Candidate access rule (tier 3).
    sense=clear  the source must be CLEAR    -> an EXCLUSION. The check is LOST once the source
                                                fires. This can never be an access rule; it is the
                                                argument FOR the missable tag, not against it.
    sense=unknown  the corpus does not encode it. NO EDGE MAY BE USED. Tallied, never guessed.

WHAT THIS IS NOT -- and this paragraph is the point of the file.

  * 🛑 It is NOT an access-rule generator. Nothing in the world reads this table. Tier 1 of the spec
    is "emit the graph, assert nothing"; the missable tag stays exactly where it is on every check
    named here. A `sense=set` edge is a CANDIDATE, and the thing that would promote it is a human
    reading this file, not this file's own confidence.
  * 🛑 An edge is CO-OCCURRENCE plus a polarity rule, not proof. `datamine_lot_gates.py` pairs every
    flag test in an event with every award in that event -- a cross product -- so a test that sits
    on a branch which never reaches the award still emits a row. This tool inherits that.
  * 🛑 ABSENCE FROM THIS TABLE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF SAFETY. Every corpus feeding it reads an AWARD
    SITE. A questline that gates whether a FIGHT EXISTS leaves no award-site trace at all, and the
    motivating case of the whole spec -- f510110, Fortissax, behind Fia's Deathbed Dream -- is
    absent from this table BY CONSTRUCTION. `--check` asserts that absence out loud, so that nobody
    reads a populated graph as a covered one. See SPEC §5 and gen_data._BOSS_ARENA_QUEST_GATED.

POLARITY, THE THING THAT MAKES OR BREAKS THIS (SPEC §4a)
--------------------------------------------------------
A false prerequisite is an unwinnable seed. A missing one costs a filler slot. So polarity is
assigned from a table of constructs, per row, and every construct not in that table yields
`unknown` rather than a plausible guess.

`lot_gates.tsv` records the construct verbatim in its `context` column precisely so this decision
happens here, once, in the open:

    commonarg/WaitFor   set      The gate arrived as a literal at an `$InitializeCommonEvent` call
                                 site and the callee tests it in a NON-NEGATED, LOCAL `WaitFor`.
                                 This is the one shape the datamine itself already filtered for:
                                 `_common_sigs()` drops acquisition-RANGE params (AllBatchEventFlags
                                 -- "already taken", not a prerequisite) and drops BAIL-OUT params
                                 (`EndIf(EventFlag(p))`, `if (p) {... EndEvent()}` -- a completion
                                 test whose polarity is inverted). What survives is a positive
                                 requirement BY CONSTRUCTION, not by this tool's reading.
                                 ✅ AND NOW MEASURED, 2026-07-28, against the real corpus (see
                                 `--verify-commonarg`). Two holes were argued to be safe but
                                 unchecked: a group negation `!(... EventFlag(p) ...)` evading the
                                 local negation test, and an `||` inside the WaitFor. Both are
                                 EMPTY: of the 6 gate params `_common_sigs()` selects, 0 sit in a
                                 group negation and 0 sit in a disjunction -- all six are pure
                                 conjunctions. So this row is verified, not merely reasoned.
    WaitFor             set      `WaitFor(... EventFlag(X) ...)` blocks until X is set.
    !WaitFor            clear    the test is negated inside the WaitFor.
    EndIf               clear    `EndIf(EventFlag(X))` TERMINATES the event when X is set, so the
                                 award below it runs only while X is CLEAR. This is the inversion
                                 the lot_gates header warns about, and reading it the naive way is
                                 how a false prerequisite gets minted.
    !EndIf              set      `EndIf(!EventFlag(X))` -- terminates while X is clear.
    anything with       unknown  🛑 THE VERB IS A CROSS PRODUCT, NOT A BINDING. Rows whose context
    /EnableAssetTreasure         carries a treasure verb are emitted once per (gate-context, verb)
    /DisableAssetTreasure        pair, so the SAME (check, gate) appears under both
    /EnableObjAct                `if/EnableAssetTreasure` AND `if/DisableAssetTreasure` when the
    /DisableObjAct               event does both on different branches. Which branch that gate
                                 governs is not in the table. Measured 2026-07-28: 20 (check, gate)
                                 pairs carry both verbs. Guessing either way is a coin flip on an
                                 unwinnable seed, so they are `unknown`. (This read "12" until it
                                 was RECOMPUTED in review -- a number in a comment is a claim, and
                                 claims rot.)
    ? / EventFlag /     unknown  accumulator (`flag &= EventFlag(X)`) and branch forms. The flag
    if / GotoIf / SkipIf         feeds a variable or a jump whose consuming branch is not recorded.
    WaitForEventFlag             (arg 1 carries ON/OFF, but it only ever co-occurs with a treasure
                                 verb here, so the cross-product objection applies anyway.)

`esd_gifts.tsv` is the happy case: `datamine_esd_gates.py` walks the ESD with an environment-carrying
descent and emits `gate_sense` ITSELF (1 = set, 0 = clear), per path. It is taken as given -- with
one guard: if the same (source, target) appears with BOTH senses across paths, the flag is not a
requirement in either direction and the pair degrades to `unknown` (`esd-paths-disagree`).

`treasure_enablers.tsv` carries `gate_verbatim` and explicitly does NOT encode polarity. Its nine
`external_gate_flags` rows get a deliberately narrow parse (see `_enabler_sense`): `set` only when
the flag appears non-negated inside a `WaitFor(... && ...)` conjunction or an enclosing
`if (EventFlag(X))`, and NEVER when it sits in a `||` alternation with something other than the
target's own acquisition flag. Everything else is `unknown`. Nine rows do not justify a parser; they
do justify saying which nine.

SIBLING EDGES: `alt_group` GROUPS THEM, `group_semantics` SAYS WHAT THE GROUPING MEANS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPEC §7 names the trap: the Stormhill Shack Golden Seed `f400191` has THREE ways to trigger it
(3708 / 3709 / 1041389414) and "a DAG with a single edge here is wrong". Three AND-edges is equally
wrong. So sibling edges are grouped by the SITE they were read at (`alt_group` = tool + target +
event/talk) -- that is what makes them siblings in the data rather than in our opinion.

🛑 GROUPING IS NOT SEMANTICS, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE CONFLATED THEM. It documented
`alt_group` as "the target needs ANY ONE of them" -- flatly, for every group. That is false on rows
this tool itself emits: the `treasure_enablers` group for f1039537050 holds three flags whose own
`gate_verbatim` is `WaitFor(EventFlag(a) && EventFlag(b) && EventFlag(c))`, a CONJUNCTION, and 16 of
41 multi-edge groups mixed `set` with `clear`, under which "any one" is not even coherent. An OR
read of that group licenses an UNDER-constrained rule -- one flag standing in for three, which is
the unwinnable-seed direction. It was a constraint WE owned, undocumented, written down as if the
game owned it: exactly the laundering CONTRIBUTING's "Constraint ownership" section is about.
(Found in review, 2026-07-28, before anything consumed it.)

So the meaning is a COLUMN now, per group, and it claims nothing unless the DATA proves otherwise:

    any       PROVEN alternatives: the group is `commonarg` rows for one common event, and each row
              is a SEPARATE `$InitializeCommonEvent` CALL SITE (`_common_arg_gates` iterates call
              sites and emits one row each). N independent instances of the same handler, each
              awaiting its own flag and each awarding the same lot, so whichever fires first pays
              out. f400191 is exactly this, and it is asserted by name.
    all       PROVEN conjunction: `treasure_enablers` rows whose external gates are the `&&`
              conjuncts of ONE condition above the enable call, none of them in an alternation.
    unknown   everything else, and it is the majority. Several flag tests in one EMEVD event body
              (`lot_gates` non-commonarg) have a control flow this corpus does not record; ESD gift
              rows are "one row PER GATE PATH" but the tsv carries no path id, so AND-within-a-path
              and OR-across-paths are indistinguishable once they land in one group.

A group is downgraded to `unknown` if its members disagree about which of those they are, if it
mixes senses, or if any member's sense is `unknown`. A consumer may only act on `any` / `all`.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION -- what KIND of thing the prerequisite is
-------------------------------------------------------------
    check       the source flag is itself a live AP check -- the only kind that could become a
                pure item/location rule with no region reasoning at all. Measured: rare.
    npc_state   an NPC talk ESD SETS it (`esd_flags.tsv`). This is the questline vocabulary: a bare
                4-digit id like 3708 is not decodable, but "talk 102001110 on m11_10 sets it" is a
                datum. ⚠️ SPEC §3 describes esd_flags.tsv as "which flags an ESD TESTS". That is
                WRONG -- the tool's own docstring and header say SETS, and the distinction matters:
                SETS is what makes the flag attributable to an NPC.
    world       set by a map's EMEVD and nothing else.
    unknown     no corpus places it.

Region resolution uses the same four locators, in the same precedence, as
`greenfield/eldenring/tests/test_gf_lot_gates_cross_region.py::_gate_region_resolver` -- flag-number
decode, then setter map, then common-event call-site map, then (weakest) the test-site map. That
test is the keeper for the region half; `test_gf_questline_dag.py` asserts this tool AGREES with it
on the overlapping rows, so the two copies cannot drift silently.

THE FOURTH CORPUS: `questline_conditions.tsv` (#1085, added 2026-08-27)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The three corpora above all read an AWARD SITE and pair a flag test with an award in the same
event. §9a of the spec records exactly what that cost, and this corpus is aimed at two of those
three recorded gaps:

  * **the source_locator gap** -- 117 of 283 tier-1 edges placed their source NOWHERE. The
    extractor walks the cone THROUGH the setter, so every root it emits arrives with the
    `file:event` (or `talk/<file>:<machine>`) that SET it. That is a locator by construction, and
    it is the strongest kind: the map whose EMEVD/ESD actually writes the flag.
  * **the f510110 gap** -- Fortissax was asserted ABSENT because an award-site corpus cannot see a
    gate on whether the FIGHT EXISTS. This one is not an award-site pairing: it resolves the guard
    cone of the remembrance award itself, per branch, so `MAP_ACCESS(m12_03)`,
    `BOSS_KILL(f12030800)` (Champions) and `ITEM_POSSESSION(goods 8191)` (Cursemark of Death)
    arrive as roots. **f510110 IS IN THE TABLE NOW**, and the acceptance case that used to assert
    its absence has been REWRITTEN rather than deleted: it now asserts BOTH halves -- still absent
    from the three award-site corpora (the blind spot is unchanged), present via this one.
    SPEC §9a's "if a future widening makes it appear, read the edge, do not delete the assertion"
    is the instruction being followed, deliberately, and the premise change is the point of the
    change (CONTRIBUTING: a PREMISE change is not a NUMBER change).

WHAT IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO CLAIM, and the three refusals that enforce it:

  1. **ADMISSION.** A row carries `cone_completeness`. `complete` (nothing refused) and
     `budget_capped` (only the per-site flag budget / depth caps were hit -- an INCOMPLETE cone can
     MISS a prerequisite, never invent one) are admitted. `unreadable` -- a guard that could not be
     read at all (UNSET_FLAG, MANY_SETTERS, WORKVALUE_UNRESOLVED, an unrecognised predicate) -- is
     REFUSED wholesale and counted. "We stopped walking" and "we could not read that guard" are
     different kinds of ignorance and only the first one leaves the surviving roots trustworthy.
  2. **`group_semantics` is ALWAYS `unknown` for this corpus.** A cone unions the arms of a
     disjunction into one conjunction (the extractor's own limit; f400191-shaped alternatives would
     therefore read as an AND), and a disjunction met further down a setter chain is not even
     marked. So a site's roots are NOT a proven conjunction and NOT proven alternatives. Per this
     file's own rule -- a consumer may act on `any`/`all` only -- every edge from this corpus is
     INERT as a rule and lives here as evidence and as a locator.
  3. **NO `clear` EDGES.** An exclusion needs the exclusive alternative to be VISIBLE, and the
     phase-2 corpus contains no IRREVERSIBLE-arm roots at all (measured: zero rows). Rather than
     mint exclusions out of negated guards -- which the extractor deliberately records as
     "negatives" and refuses to expand, because "keep this OFF" is a self-gate far more often than
     it is a questline branch -- this producer emits `set` only, and the tally says so out loud.

The table is a hand emit (the decompiled EMEVD/ESD is licensing-restricted and absent from CI), so
it is ABSENT-OK exactly like `flag_names.tsv`: the build must work without it and must SAY that it
did, rather than silently reporting a tier-1-shaped graph as if nothing were missing.

INPUT:  committed `greenfield/*.tsv` + the generated `eldenring/{data,missable_locations}.py`.
        AP-free and artifact-free: it runs in the agent sandbox, like build_check_browser.py.

# AUTO-GENERATED by tools/build_questline_dag.py -- DO NOT EDIT, re-emit.
# TIER 1 of docs/specs/SPEC-questline-dag-20260728.md: EMIT THE GRAPH, ASSERT NOTHING.
# Directed edges over EVENT FLAGS. target_flag is always a live AP check.
#   sense=set     the source must be SET   -> a PREREQUISITE. A CANDIDATE access rule, not one yet.
#   sense=clear   the source must be CLEAR -> an EXCLUSION. Never an access rule; this is the
#                 argument FOR the missable tag.
#   sense=unknown the corpus does not encode the polarity. UNUSABLE. Tallied, never guessed.
# 🛑 NOTHING IN THE WORLD READS THIS FILE. Every check named here keeps its missable tag.
# 🛑 An edge is CO-OCCURRENCE + a polarity rule, not proof: datamine_lot_gates pairs every flag test
#   in an event with every award in it, so a test on a branch that never reaches the award is here.
# 🛑 ABSENCE IS NOT SAFETY. The three AWARD-SITE corpora (lot_gates, esd_gifts, treasure_enablers)
#   pair a flag test with an award in the same event, so a questline that gates whether a FIGHT
#   EXISTS leaves them no trace at all -- f510110 (Fortissax) was absent from them BY CONSTRUCTION
#   and still is, which the acceptance block below asserts.
# 🛑 THE FOURTH CORPUS, `questline_conditions` (#1085), IS NOT AN AWARD-SITE PAIRING: it resolves
#   the guard cone of the award itself, per branch, through the setters -- so f510110 IS in this
#   table now, with its ancestry, and its citation places the source. Those edges are DELIBERATELY
#   INERT: their group_semantics is always `unknown` (a cone unions the arms of a disjunction, so
#   its roots are neither proven alternatives nor a proven conjunction) and this file's own rule is
#   that a consumer may act on `any`/`all` only. Cones with an UNREADABLE guard are refused
#   wholesale and counted; the corpus emits no `clear` edge because it resolves no
#   IRREVERSIBLE-arm root to read an exclusion off.
# alt_group groups edges READ AT ONE SITE; `group_semantics` says what that grouping MEANS, and it
#   is `unknown` unless the data proves otherwise -- `any` only for separate call sites of one
#   common event (f400191's three triggers), `all` only for the `&&` conjuncts of one enabler
#   condition (f1039537050's three). 🛑 An earlier version called EVERY group "alternatives"; that
#   was OUR claim wearing the game's clothes, and an OR read of a conjunction is an
#   UNDER-constrained rule. A consumer may act on `any` / `all` only.
# source_locator: how the source's region was placed -- flag_decode > setter_map > common_map >
#   test_map (WEAKEST: where the flag MATTERS, not where it lives -- good enough for a missable tag,
#   never for an access rule). Empty = unplaced. `esd_talk_map` = the talk ESD that SETS it;
#   `map_id` = a MAP_ACCESS root, whose source names its map outright rather than decoding a flag.
# source_kind `item` / `map_access` and a NAMESPACED source (`goods:8191`, `map:m12_03`) come from
#   the extractor corpus: a possession or map-reach requirement is not an event flag, and goods ids
#   and event flags are different ID SPACES -- the prefix is there so nothing reads one as the other.

    THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. `_CONTEXT_SENSE` maps `commonarg/WaitFor` to `set` on the grounds that
    `datamine_lot_gates._common_sigs()` has already reduced those params to positive requirements:
    it drops acquisition-RANGE params (`AllBatchEventFlags` -- "already taken") and BAIL-OUT params
    (`EndIf(EventFlag(p))`, `if (p) {... EndEvent()}` -- completion tests with inverted polarity),
    and requires a non-negated occurrence inside a local `WaitFor`. That is 123 of the 173
    `lot_gates` edges, so it is the single largest polarity claim in the table.

    THE TWO HOLES it does not close by construction, both argued to be safe:
      1. the negation test is LOCAL (`!` immediately before `EventFlag(p)`), so a GROUP negation
         `WaitFor(!( ... EventFlag(p) ... ))` would read as positive when it is the opposite;
      2. a `||` inside the WaitFor makes the flag one of several ways in, not a requirement --
         over-constraining, which is the safe direction, but still not what the row claims.

    Both were UNCHECKED until the corpus was linked (2026-07-28), and both measured EMPTY: 0 of 6
    selected gate params in either shape. This re-runs that measurement rather than leaving a
    number in a comment to rot. It is opt-in because the EMEVD is licensing-restricted and absent
    from CI -- the same `ER_ARTIFACTS_VV` precedent AGENTS §5 sets for staged artifact work.
