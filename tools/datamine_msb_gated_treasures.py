"""datamine_msb_gated_treasures.py -- treasures that DO NOT EXIST at map load (StartDisabled=1).

WHY
---
The long-running "checks gated behind something else" hunt looked in two places and found nothing:
  * EMEVD -- flag 67050 and its lot appear NOWHERE in all 589 decompiled files, and only 32 of 1824
    corpse flags (1.8%) appear anywhere in the EMEVD at all. It is the least script-visible pickup
    class in the game (chests 11.5%, all msb_flag_region 15.2%).
  * ESD -- the NPC-state flag vocabulary (esd_flags.tsv) is DISJOINT from pickup acquisition flags:
    0 of 2803 msb_flag_region, 0 of 1824 corpse.
Both were dead ends because the answer was never in a script. It is a FIELD ON THE MSB RECORD.

`MSB Event/Treasure` carries `<StartDisabled>`. When it is 1 the pickup is not in the world at load.
The hypothesis was that something must therefore ENABLE it later, making this the "regioned correctly
but cannot exist yet" class -- a missing ACCESS RULE invisible to every region oracle.

🛑 THE HYPOTHESIS IS DISPROVEN. Do not re-inherit it; the number below is the reason.
MEASURED 2026-07-25, whole corpus, this tool's own `--probe` output:

    InChest=0  StartDisabled=0 : 3112      InChest=0  StartDisabled=1 :   1
    InChest=1  StartDisabled=0 :  117      InChest=1  StartDisabled=1 : 141
    InChest=2  StartDisabled=0 :  502      InChest=2  StartDisabled=1 :  21

162 of the 163 StartDisabled=1 records are InChest>=1. Of the 3113 pickups NOT in a container,
exactly ONE is StartDisabled -- 0.03%. StartDisabled tracks the CONTAINER, not access: an item in a
closed chest is not in the world until the lid opens, which is the ordinary chest, not a gate.

The structural confirmation is in the `asset_entity_id` column this tool now emits. EnableAssetTreasure
is addressed by an ENTITY ID, and 54 of the 136 distinct live checks here have NO entity id at all --
Treasure EntityID 0 AND Part/Asset EntityID 0 -- so no EMEVD instruction can ever name them. They are
nonetheless ordinary loot: Stormveil's Godslayer's Seal and Curved Sword Talisman, Leyndell's Blessed
Dew Talisman, five Farum Azula chests, Roundtable Hold's Assassin's Prayerbook. A field whose only
proposed meaning is "an event must enable this" cannot mean that on 54 checks no event can address.

tools/datamine_treasure_enablers.py does the enabler join anyway and lands 18 of 136 with any enabler
at all, of which 13 are in-place ("break the pot", "open the carriage") and exactly ONE is a genuine
cross-region prerequisite. THIS TABLE IS NOT A RISK LIST. It is the candidate set that produced that
answer, and it is kept because the columns are the join keys, not because the rows are suspects.

MEASURED (all 1347 *-msb-dcx dirs, 2026-07-25): 3894 Treasure records, 163 StartDisabled=1 (4.2%).
Those 163 ROWS carry only 148 DISTINCT flags -- several treasure records share one lot -- of which
140 are LIVE AP checks (13 corpses). Rows and checks are different numbers; the tool prints both.

🛑 THE EXEMPLAR THAT STARTED THE HUNT IS NOT IN THIS SET. f67050 has StartDisabled=0, its asset is
`NeverDisable` with no condition, and both Fextralife and Game8 place it on "a dead man sitting" at
the collapsed bridge to Stormveil with NO Roderika involvement and no gate. The handoff's "the
cookbook Roderika leaves at Stormhill Shack ... does not exist until you rest at a Liurnia grace" was
never sourced and looks like a conflation of two different things. Do not re-inherit it.

WHAT THIS TABLE IS NOT
----------------------
`StartDisabled=1` says a pickup starts absent. It does NOT say what enables it, and it does NOT by
itself mean the check is misregioned or unwinnable -- some are enabled immediately by their map's own
setup. It is a CANDIDATE SET for access-rule review, not a verdict. Treating a row here as a proven
bug is the same error as treating the EMEVD's silence as proof of no gating.

OUTPUT: greenfield/msb_gated_treasures.tsv
    map_id, treasure_name, item_lot_id, treasure_part, entity_id, flag, is_live_check, is_corpse

USAGE:
    python tools/datamine_msb_gated_treasures.py --root elden_ring_artifacts/mapstudio --probe
    python tools/datamine_msb_gated_treasures.py --root elden_ring_artifacts/mapstudio
⚠️ --state PATH checkpoints progress and resumes. That exists because the agent sandbox reads this
tree over a MOUNT and a full walk exceeds the harness's hard 45s command cap; on a local disk the
whole scan is one pass and the flag is unnecessary.
