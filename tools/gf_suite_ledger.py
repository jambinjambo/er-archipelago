"""The suite ledger: every repo-only test suite is EITHER run by a CI job OR explicitly dark.

WHY (inert-test audit finding #3, 2026-08-04). The `generators` CI job used to run a hand-typed
list of 12 suite names. Anything that skips in the installed-world `tests` job and is missing from
that list runs NOWHERE except the dev box -- and that is precisely how test_gf_scadu_supply's
client-rung mirror and test_gf_data's client-table gates fell dark: their sibling
(scaling_ladder_mirror) was in the list, they were not, and a green run looks identical either way.

So the list is now DERIVED, not typed:

  * this file is the single ledger; `--generators-list` emits the loop the workflow iterates
    (.github/workflows/tests.yaml), so a suite cannot be "in CI" without a ledger row;
  * `--check` scans greenfield/eldenring/tests/ for the repo-only SENTINELS (REPO_ONLY_REASON,
    elden_ring_artifacts, the client checkout path, find_repo_root, tools/gen_manifest,
    tools/upgrade_costs). Any sentinel-bearing suite that is not ledgered fails RED. A new
    repo-only suite therefore cannot be silently dark: its author must either put it in a CI
    bucket or write down, in this file, why it only runs on the dev box.

The three buckets, and what enforces each claim:

  GENERATORS   -- run as __main__ scripts by the `generators` job (AP-free, repo tree + client at
                  the gitlink). Enforced by the job itself: the loop is generated from this list.
  TESTS_JOB    -- run under pytest in the `tests` job (installed world; artifacts materialised
                  from the gen_inputs bundle; client checked out at the gitlink beside the repo).
                  Partial skips inside these suites are pinned, per reason family and count, by
                  tests/expected_skips_ci.json (gf_test.py --skip-census) -- if one of these
                  re-darkens, the census goes red, not green.
  DEV_BOX_ONLY -- every test in the suite skips in CI, with the honest reason recorded here.
                  Their skip counts are ALSO census families, so one of them silently waking or
                  growing goes red too.
