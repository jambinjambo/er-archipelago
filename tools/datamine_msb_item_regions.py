r"""datamine_msb_item_regions.py -- authoritative flag -> map GROUND TRUTH for item checks.

A check's *physical map* is knowable without ever consulting region_map.csv or gen_data's region
assignment. That independence is the whole point: the §1 provenance oracle
(test_gf_region_provenance_oracle.py) cross-checks data.py against THIS, so a mis-pinned location is
caught mechanically instead of in-game. See SPEC-provenance-oracle-20260710.md.

THREE independent provenance chains, one per `source` column value:

  source=treasure   (v1)  the MSB *is* the map: a Treasure event places an ItemLotParam_map row
      physically in a known map block.
          mapstudio/<map>-msb-dcx/Event/Treasure/*.xml  -> <ItemLotID>
          -> ItemLotParam_map.ID -> getItemFlagId*      -> flag

  source=enemy      (v2)  an enemy is *placed* as a Part in a known map, and its NpcParam carries the
      lots it drops. Covers NPC invaders / named enemies whose drops carry acquisition flags.
          mapstudio/<map>-msb-dcx/Part/Enemy/*.xml      -> <NPCParamID>
          -> NpcParam.itemLotId_enemy -> ItemLotParam_enemy.ID -> getItemFlagId*  -> flag
          -> NpcParam.itemLotId_map   -> ItemLotParam_map.ID   -> getItemFlagId*  -> flag

  source=event      (v2)  BOSS drops (remembrances, great runes, boss rewards) are NOT NpcParam drops
      and NOT map Treasures -- they are awarded by EMEVD. The emevd file is per-map, so the map is
      still ground truth. Three award sites, all resolved mechanically (no hand tables):
        a) literal  AwardItemLot(N) / AwardItemsIncludingClients(N)  in m<XX>...emevd.dcx.js
        b) $InitializeCommonEvent(_, E, args...) where common_func's $Event(E, ...) has an
           `itemLotId`-named parameter (the boss handlers 90005860/861/880 et al) -> args[thatIdx]
        c) common.emevd registers flag-gated award events, e.g.
               $Event(1100, Default, function(eventFlagId, itemLotId, itemLotId2, eventFlagId2) {
                   ... WaitFor(EventFlag(eventFlagId)); AwardItemsIncludingClients(itemLotId); ... })
               $InitializeEvent(18, 1100, 9118, 10180, 0, 197);   // flag 9118 -> lot 10180
           so we build triggerFlag -> lots from common.emevd, then attribute those lots to whichever
           MAP emevd SETs the trigger flag ON (m14_00 sets 9118 -> lot 10180 -> flag 197, Rennala's
           Remembrance of the Full Moon Queen). That is the chain that would have caught the 2026-07-08
           "flag 197 pinned to Stormveil" mis-pin, which v1 (Treasure-only) was blind to.
      Lot ids are looked up in ItemLotParam_map first, then ItemLotParam_enemy.

Reads (all under elden_ring_artifacts, licensing-restricted, .gitignore'd):
  * mapstudio/<map>-msb-dcx/{Event/Treasure,Part/Enemy}/*.xml   (witchy MSBE export; dir name = map)
  * event/m*.emevd.dcx.js, event/common.emevd.dcx.js, event/common_func.emevd.dcx.js  (EMEVD decompile)
  * vanilla_er/vanilla_er/{ItemLotParam_map,ItemLotParam_enemy,NpcParam}.csv   (Smithbox param dump)

Emits greenfield/msb_flag_region.tsv:  flag \t map_id \t item_lot_id \t treasure_name \t source
`map_id` is the raw MSB/emevd map (e.g. m10_00, m60_51_57); mapping map_id -> gf region is the oracle's
job (kept OUT of here so the extractor stays a pure, independent ground-truth source). `treasure_name`
is the MSB Treasure part name for source=treasure, the MSB Enemy part name for source=enemy, and the
award site (e.g. `award`, `common90005860`, `trigflag9118`) for source=event.

A flag may legitimately appear in SEVERAL maps (an invader placed in three tiles, a shared/common drop
lot). Disambiguating that is the ORACLE's job (it excludes flags whose maps span >1 region); the
extractor just reports every placement it can prove.

Run on WINDOWS (mount is native there; the full 1000+ MSB scan is slow over the sandbox FUSE mount):
